## Highlights
But there is still a need (even a hunger) for the vision, direction, and rallying cry that a good roadmap provides. — location: [108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=108) ^ref-34635

“It’s all about solving problems, not implementing features. Conventional product roadmaps are all about output. Strong teams know it’s not only about implementing a solution; they must ensure that solution actually solves the underlying problem. It’s about results.” — location: [113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=113) ^ref-18571

Marty Cagan once again nails it: framing from problems and outcomes

This role has been compared to “a mini CEO,” but we think that overstates the level of control most product people have. We prefer the analogy of the executive chef, the person who brings together kitchen staff, menu, and purchasing — and even trains the front-of-house staff — all in order to bring in customers, satisfy their hunger, and make money for the business. It is not enough for an executive chef to simply distribute the work, but each team member must understand whom they are serving, and why they are doing things a certain way, so as to create a seamless experience for the customer. — location: [118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=118) ^ref-25360

It is your vision for how your products will help achieve your organization’s strategic goals. A good roadmap inspires buy-in and over-delivery from your entire organization. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=231) ^ref-35945

---
A traditional roadmap is not flexible enough for the lean and agile methods many teams have adopted, and it is often light on the strategic context necessary for teams to understand the overall vision. — location: [233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=233) ^ref-14951

---
A good roadmap is not so much a project plan as a strategic communication tool, a statement of intent and direction. — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=235) ^ref-22641

In the 1980s, Motorola began using the term roadmap to align technology and product development. Technology roadmaps became widely accepted in the 1990s across the semiconductor industry and were eventually adopted by many other technology-driven organizations, including Microsoft, Google, and Oracle. — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=278) ^ref-39197

---
A product roadmap should: Put the organization’s plans in a strategic context Focus on delivering value to customers and the organization Embrace learning as part of a successful product development process Rally the organization around a single set of priorities Get customers excited about the product’s direction At the same time, a product roadmap should not: Make promises product teams aren’t confident they will deliver on Require a wasteful process of up-front design and estimation Be conflated with a project plan or a release plan (we cannot stress this enough) — location: [307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=307) ^ref-27914

---
A Roadmap Should Put the Organization’s Plans in a Strategic Context Problem: Nobody understands why things are on the roadmap — location: [326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=326) ^ref-54051

---
too often forget to clearly explain their thinking to the people involved in execution. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=332) ^ref-29910

---
The roadmap is a critical — and frequently missed — opportunity to articulate why you are doing this product, why it’s important, and why the things on it are absolutely vital to success. — location: [335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=335) ^ref-27937

---
Tie the roadmap to a compelling vision of the future “This is our vision of why we’re here and what we’re trying to accomplish for clients, and here’s the roadmap that’s going to help us progressively get there.” — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=340) ^ref-47077

---
A Roadmap Should Focus on Delivering Value to Customers and the Organization Problem: You are shipping a lot but not making progress — location: [354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=354) ^ref-61075

---
Many teams have begun measuring the actual effect of additions or changes to their product on customer behavior and business results, but this is usually absent from the roadmap. The only criteria left for management to judge success of product development efforts, then, is whether the team shipped on time — but does being on schedule make any difference if you have no effect on customer behavior or business results? — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=365) ^ref-1360

---
Features meet the specs without solving the problem for the customer. — location: [370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=370) ^ref-27699

---
we recommend starting with the chunks of value you intend to deliver that will build up over time to accomplish your vision. Often this is a set of high-level customer needs, problems, or jobs to be done, which we call themes. — location: [376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=376) ^ref-11902

---
The garden hose product roadmap might, then, include a statement of the customer’s need for (i.e., a theme of) “indestructibility.” — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=380) ^ref-62787

---
Of course, there were some of what we call guardrails and goalposts. Within those guardrails, they could decide what that product looked like or how we were going to go to market.” — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=383) ^ref-24455

---
Critically for the roadmap, these guardrails also provide a means of judging when you are done that is separate from the due dates. To return to our earlier example, you are done when you have an indestructible hose you can manufacture and sell at a profit. — location: [384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=384) ^ref-32818

the idea that uncovering themes to deliver value is more important than simply hitting deadlines: — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=386) ^ref-7850

---
Solution: Commit to outcomes rather than output — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=412) ^ref-61766

---
A Roadmap Should Rally the Organization Around a Single Set of Priorities Problem: Marketing and sales are not selling what you are making — location: [430](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=430) ^ref-647

---
having the right strategy only matters if there’s total alignment around it. When marketing is telling one story, sales is selling something different, and engineering is building something different still, then product management’s strategy is hollow and irrelevant. The roadmap must align all the stakeholders around a common product plan.” — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=436) ^ref-15944

---
You can’t do everything at once, so you have to pick and choose. — location: [441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=441) ^ref-30115

---
Solution: Align everyone around common goals and priorities — location: [449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=449) ^ref-17354

---
“Every product manager actually has their own stakeholder advisory group — cross-functional representatives that they work with to get input on: What are priorities for sales? What are priorities from the clinical team? What does security need in the roadmap? The product team is very much responsible for taking all of the different inputs and saying, ‘This is it.’” — location: [454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=454) ^ref-57575

A Roadmap Should Get Customers Excited About the Product Direction — location: [460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=460) ^ref-50486

Prioritization is critical to deliver on your commitments — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=502) ^ref-36942

A roadmap is a strategic document that should offer guidance to your teams on what to focus on. — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=502) ^ref-49126

---
When teams are building something new, regardless of their skill set, it’s a challenge to accurately predict the length of time it will take. But precise prioritization can help focus the team so they can make the most effective use of their time. — location: [507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=507) ^ref-5947

---
A Roadmap Should Not Require Wasteful Up-Front Design and Estimation — location: [509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=509) ^ref-15083

---
A Roadmap Should Not Be Conflated with a Release Plan or a Project Plan Problem: Your team looks at the roadmap as if it were a project plan listing when features will be released A roadmap is a strategic artifact, whereas a release plan is a tactical artifact about execution. — location: [522](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=522) ^ref-27393

I thi k this may have been my proobldem: I had  treated the roadmap as the execution plan.

We find that inexperienced product pros often jump to the solution. After all, we’ve been acculturated to have “the answer” since we were in kindergarten. It’s a natural bias we all have — we want the answer and we want to be problem solvers. The issue is that we go right to the solution (output) rather than do what experienced product pros do, which is focus on the problem (outcome). To take it a step further, the smartest product pros ask what outcomes they’re seeking and drive toward those. — location: [531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=531) ^ref-7078

needs to tell the story of what it will be like when you achieve your vision, what it will take to get there, and how you will know if you are making progress. — location: [565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076VX53K1&location=565) ^ref-43399
