## Highlights
Jeff described Amazon this way: “Our culture is four things: customer obsession instead of competitor obsession; willingness to think long term, with a longer investment horizon than most of our peers; eagerness to invent, which of course goes hand in hand with failure; and then, finally, taking professional pride in operational excellence.” — location: [48](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=48) ^ref-42539

bias for separable teams run by leaders with a singular focus that optimizes for speed of delivery and innovation; the use of written narratives instead of slide decks to ensure that deep understanding of complex issues drives well-informed decisions; a relentless focus on input metrics to ensure that teams work on activities that propel the business. And finally there is the product development process that gives this book its name: working backwards from the desired customer experience. — location: [62](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=62) ^ref-33530

The reason for the silence? A six-page document that everyone must read before discussion begins. — location: [1413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1413) ^ref-2581

Amazon relies far more on the written word to develop and communicate ideas than most companies, and this difference makes for a huge competitive advantage. — location: [1414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1414) ^ref-59625

The first is known as the “six-pager.” It is used to describe, review, or propose just about any type of idea, process, or business. The second narrative form is the PR/FAQ. This one is specifically linked to the Working Backwards process for new product development. In this chapter, we’ll focus on the six-pager and in the following chapter we’ll look at the PR/FAQ. — location: [1417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1417) ^ref-7542
