## Highlights
“It was just the tool you’d use to put the final report together,” the analyst told me, referring to claims about Palantir’s intelligence prowess as “this totally fake thing.” In reality, Palantir’s role in the bin Laden killing would have been limited to “making a pretty picture and then taking a screenshot and putting it at the end of a PowerPoint that was sent to leadership.” — location: [2519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08T236GWQ&location=2519) ^ref-16648

They considered bribing employees to sabotage Gawker’s operations, spying and then attempting to embarrass Denton, or even bugging the newsroom. “There were all these things that you could be tempted to do and it’s not clear they would work any better,” Thiel would later say. “So we decided very early on we would only do things that are totally legal, which is a big limitation.” — location: [3131](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08T236GWQ&location=3131) ^ref-62734

The company “was always anti-Trump,” the president tweeted in September, comparing the social network with the “fake news” New York Times and Washington Post. Bannon suggested that the White House might go further, by regulating Facebook and Google like utilities—essentially controlling prices on advertisements and ensuring that the companies didn’t skew content ideologically (that is, against conservatives); Trump would return to this threat throughout his presidency. — location: [4738](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08T236GWQ&location=4738) ^ref-12901
