## Highlights
Included in the outlier list are clonidine and its sister drug, guanfacine, which is sold and promoted in its long-acting form as Intuniv. These are both old blood pressure medicines that are extremely useful alone or in combination with stimulants. Their major effect is to calm agitation, aggression, and emotional hypersensitivity, along with assisting with focus and attention. One of the reasons these outlier drugs are gaining in importance is because of a newly understood disorder called rejection-sensitive dysphoria, or RSD. This is extreme emotional pain triggered by the perception, real or imagined, that a person has been rejected, ridiculed, or criticized by important people in their life. RSD may also be triggered by a sense of falling short, such as failing to meet their own high standards or the expectations of others. Rejection sensitivity is often a part of ADHD. As discussed in chapter 1, those with ADHD have a tendency to dwell on the “slights” of normal life and amplify their effect. Often, a person with RSD and ADHD is hypervigilant, trying at all costs to diminish these feelings. This can lead to misreading the cues of others, or withdrawing from their lives to avoid the anticipated slights. RSD can also lead to aggressive outbursts and temper tantrums as a person attempts to fight back against imagined threats. William Dodson, a wonderful psychiatrist who is leading the way in helping us understand the prevalence of this disorder, says that just knowing there is a name for this feeling comforts patients. Whether it is isolated RSD or RSD that coexists with ADHD, it makes a difference to people to realize they are not alone. By naming it, they can actively attempt to tame it, staving off the downward spiral to despair. For those who are deeply affected by RSD, about one in three people feel relief from this despair with a combination of clonidine and guanfacine. While there is no risk of abuse with these medications, they can cause a patient’s blood pressure to drop significantly. And stopping the regime should be done slowly, as otherwise it can cause a significant rise in blood pressure and pulse. — location: [1899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0871LK27X&location=1899) ^ref-32479
