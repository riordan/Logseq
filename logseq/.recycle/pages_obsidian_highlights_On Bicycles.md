## Highlights
in general, the high-wheelers became synonymous with men, and young, white, and sporting ones in particular. — location: [489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=489) ^ref-12998

The Brooklyn Daily Eagle probably summed up the general mood when it threw its support behind the resolution even as it belittled the latest bicycle craze as a “nuisance,” proclaimed that only men infected with an “extraordinary lunacy” would dare to ride the tottering bicycles, and predicted that the fanatics and their ridiculously large wheels would disappear in short order. — location: [504](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=504) ^ref-32508

One of the horses rammed into the seventeen-year-old, and she died on the scene. The coachman blamed her death on a bicycle, which had allegedly spooked his horses. — location: [511](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=511) ^ref-51701

the growing concern that bicycles would scare horses and that “bicyclers would take a sort of pleasure” in doing so — location: [517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=517) ^ref-61466

Their testimony revolved around the contested issue of whether bicycles irritated horses. They all said essentially the same thing: they had been cycling for the last two years, they had seen many a horse, and while a few horses shied away, rarely did they seem terribly bothered.56 Thirty-nine witnesses for the other side told a different story that echoed what had happened to the young woman killed in Brooklyn the year before. Thanks to careless cyclists, one driver testified, he had suffered a black eye, a concussion, and lost “part of his eyebrow.” A mother and daughter reported that they had been violently tossed from their buggy. Another driver recounted being thrown into a ditch in a hit and run.57 Despite claims of — location: [552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=552) ^ref-58882

Although the early cyclists had money, their adventurous streak often put them at odds with the more traditional elite. Tricycles—slower, safer, and more carriagelike—appeared tamer, which is why two of the three law testers rode them instead of the precarious two-wheelers. — location: [561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=561) ^ref-62845

Could they stop as fast as a carriage? The witnesses reported that they needed between five and fifteen feet to stop, explaining that cyclists braked by applying backward pressure on the pedals (proudly, most did not use actual brakes). One witness claimed to be able to “vault right off” in an instant.58 — location: [565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=565) ^ref-42399

In a memorable 1898 race it was Charles Miller who earned first place. Like everyone else, he took short breaks to sleep. Unlike his competition, he also spent thirty minutes getting married. Nonetheless, he completed a dizzying 21,050 laps over the six days of racing. — location: [879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=879) ^ref-2981

the bicycle had significant limitations. It could only take riders as far as their legs could muster, which is why cyclists often relied on several forms of transportation. Hyde regularly biked to train stations and ferry docks and would carry his wheels aboard. He took plenty of long “runs,” but spending a day casually touring the Hudson River towns required getting there more quickly than by bicycle. Understandably, cyclists fought for the right to be able to bring their bicycles on trains—and to do so for free. — location: [903](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=903) ^ref-55276

The change, rather perversely, was something enthusiasts had long advocated: less expensive bicycles and more types of cyclists. The fashionable bicycles were no longer considered such when prices dropped and as more New Yorkers became cyclists. — location: [1304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=1304) ^ref-19126

In short, the bicycle lost its power as a status symbol. As its social value began to fade, so did hopes that the bicycle was the magic solution to cure the ills of modern society and the modern city. — location: [1307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=1307) ^ref-1877

Mayoral candidate and famous conservative William F. Buckley Jr. proposed building an elevated bicycle highway on Second Avenue, running from 125th to First Street. Standing 20 feet above the ground, stretching 20 feet across, and with 6 spurs heading crosstown, the bikeway could solve the traffic riddle below and, for just a 15-cent toll, offer a healthy and speedy way to commute. “To go back to the age of the bicycle,” an amused Buckley told reporters, might be “ultra-reactionary,” but it sure would be fun. — location: [1879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=1879) ^ref-50689

Although they did not get a new elevated path, opportunistic cyclists seized on the next best thing: repurposing the elevated West Side Highway after it was closed to automobiles in 1973 (following its partial collapse when a dump truck loaded with asphalt, ironically on its way to repair the very same highway, proved too heavy for the aging road). — location: [2014](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07L9JS157&location=2014) ^ref-40585
