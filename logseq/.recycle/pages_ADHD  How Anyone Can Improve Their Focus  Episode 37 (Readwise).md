Now many people do that. Not just people with A. D. H. D. But people with A. D. H. D. Have challenges understanding how to line up the activities of their day in order to meet particular deadlines. Even if it's just a simple thing like finishing one set of tasks before lunch. Oftentimes they will remember that lunch starts at noon but somehow they aren't able to fill the intervening time in a way that's productive and they can obsess about the upcoming deadline for instance we will talk about how to remedy this.

They will take many belongings and this could be in the kitchen or in their bedroom or in their office or in any space and they will start piling things up according to a categorization system. That makes sense to them and only them it doesn't really have any logical framework. Many people use the pile system and if you use the pile system that doesn't mean that you have A. D. H. D. In fact if you're unpacking a house or you've moved recently or you've received a lot of presents recently. The pile system makes perfect sense to organize your space. But people with A. D. H. D. Tend to organize things according to the pile system all the time. And that pile system doesn't work for them. Okay so that's the key distinction that they use a

But then it doesn't work for them in terms of what tasks they actually need to perform. They can't find things or if anyone moves one thing that it it's very disruptive to their overall plan because their overall plan doesn't really work in the first place. So that's a common Fiona type as we call

Have real trouble with is so called working memory. Now you might think that people with A. D. H. D. Would have really poor memories but in fact that's not the case. People with A. D. H. D. Often can have a terrific memory for past events they can remember upcoming events quite well. Their memory is clearly working. However one aspect of memory in particular that we call working memory is often disrupted. Working memory is the ability to keep specific information online to recycle it in your brain over and over again so that you can use it in the immediate or short term. A good example of this would be you meet

A good example of this would be you meet somebody they tell you their name. They give you their phone number verbally and you have to walk back to your phone and enter it into your phone. People without A. D. H. D. Might have to put some effort into it. It might feel like a bit of a struggle but typically they would be able to recite that phone number in their mind over and over and then put into their phone. People with A. D. H. D. Tend to lose the ability or lack the ability To remember things that they just need to keep online for anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute or two. Okay so a string of numbers like 643781

People with 88 she have severe challenges even with much smaller batches of information over even much smaller batches of time deficits in working memory are also something that we see in people who have frontotemporal dementia so damage to the frontal lobes or age related cognitive decline. And so it will come as no surprise that later when we discuss treatments supplements and other tools for A. D. H. D. That many of those treatments supplements and tools for A. D. H. D. Are similar to the ones that work for age related cognitive decline. Okay so we've more or less

The default mode networks and the task networks are actually more coordinated. That might come as surprising. I think that we all have this tendency to kind of jump to conclusion and assume that somebody who doesn't have an easy time paying attention or has A. D. H. D. That their brain must be completely incoherent that that's not working well and because everything is out of whack. But there's something interesting about people with A. D. H. D.

	  Speaker 0: the so called low dopamine hypothesis of A. D. H. D. The idea that dopamine was somehow involved or Not at the appropriate levels in people with 88, she had been around for a pretty long time. But a formal proposition of the low dopamine hypothesis led to some really important experiments and understanding of what goes wrong in A. D. H. D. It turns out that if dopamine levels are too low in particular circuits in the brain that it leads to unnecessary firing of neurons in the brain that are unrelated to the task that one is trying to do and that is unrelated to the information that one is trying to focus on. So if you think back before you got this default mode

	  Speaker 0: when dopamine is too low neurons fire more than they should in these networks that govern attention. This is the so called low dopamine hypothesis. And if you start looking anecdotally at what people with A. D. H. D. Have done for decades Not just recently since the low dopamine hypothesis has been proposed, but what they were doing in the 1950s and in the 1940s and the 1960s, what you find is that they tend to use recreational drugs or they tend to indulge in non drug stimulants. So things like drinking six cups of coffee or quadruple espressos

Would take recreational drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine or would drink coffee to excess or smoke cigarettes to excess because they had poor levels of attention and because they couldn't make good decisions they were too impulsive and so forth. And while that certainly could be the case, knowing what we now know about dopamine and the fact that having enough dopamine is required in order to coordinate these neural circuits that allow for focus and quality decision making. An equally valid idea is that these Children and these adults are actually trying to self medicate by pursuing these compounds Right. Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine.

Tend to have many more attentional blinks than people that don't. And this is true for Children and for adults this is an important point. So important that I want to emphasize it twice in case you intentionally blinked.

Okay now young Children fortunately don't have access to those kinds of stimulants most of the time. And those stimulants all have high potential for abuse in adults. So we will talk about the potential for abuse in a few minutes. But if you look at Children even very young Children with A. D. H. D. They show things like preference for sugary foods which also act as dopamine inducing stimulants. Now of

And has a child who is on the precipice of perhaps starting to take drugs for the treatment of A. D. H. D. I asked the simple question. Do you see an effective diet meaning when parents control the diet of their Children doesn't make a positive or negative or no difference in terms of The way that the kids respond to 80 HD drugs like Ritalin and Adderall or whether or not it can help them avoid treating with those drugs entirely. And her response was very straightforward. She said elimination of simple sugars has a dramatic and positive effect. She's observed that over and over and

	  Speaker 0: and low levels of dopamine apparently are what's wrong in people with A. D. H. D. That dopamine hypothesis is what led to the idea that treating people Children and adults included with dopamine urgent compounds would somehow increase their ability to focus. And if you look at the major drugs that were developed and now marketed by pharmaceutical companies for the treatment of A. D. H. D. Those drugs have names like Ritalin. Nowadays it's typically things like add a role modafinil and some of the other derivatives. They all serve to increase levels of dopamine in particular dopamine in the networks that control task directed behavior and that

So things like drinking six cups of coffee or quadruple espressos or when it was more prominent, smoking a half a pack of cigarettes and drinking four cups of coffee a day. Or if the person had access to it using cocaine as a recreational drug or amphetamine as a recreational drug. All of those substances that I just described in particular cocaine and amphetamine but also coffee and cigarettes, increased levels of multiple neurotransmitters but all have the quality of increasing levels of dopamine in the brain and in particular in the regions of the brain that regulate attention and these task related and default mode networks.

It was a diet in which each kid took a test to determine which foods they had antibodies for meaning that they were mildly allergic to. Now in this study it was very important that the kids not be extremely allergic to any food Because as I mentioned before they actually served as a control at one point in the study where they were eating all sorts of foods including foods that they had mild allergies too. So basically what the study said was that eliminating foods to which Children have allergies can dramatically improve their symptoms of A. D. H. D.

So uh meaning that it wasn't in the bloodstream very long and didn't affect the brain for very long And so the dosages could be controlled in a more typical way without going into a lot of tangential detail as you all know at different times of day. You tend to be more or less alert. So a long sustained release drug while that might sound like a really terrific thing if that drug is having an effect of making you more alert and it's released across very many hours of your day. There might be periods of your day when you feel to alert periods of your day when you feel just right and periods of your day when you wished that you were more alert.

And if they can find particular foods that exacerbate the symptoms obviously eliminating those foods is beneficial and the foods that exacerbate their symptoms change over time. So I don't like giving a complicated answer but I also don't like giving an incomplete answer. What this tells me is that Children especially young Children who have A. D. H. D. Should probably not eat much sugar in particular. Simple sugars in addition to that

It should also be exciting to anyone that cares about increasing their focus and their ability to attend. What this is saying is that these circuits that underlie focus on our ability to attend and our ability to eliminate distraction. They aren't just failing to focus. That's just a semantic way of describing the outcome. They are over focusing on certain things and thereby missing other things and so are distractibility or the distractibility of somebody with A.

So the basic takeaway of this study was that blinking controls time perception but also that levels of dopamine can alter your sense of time and stay with me here and that blinking and dopamine are inextricably linked. They are working together to control your attention when dopamine levels go up. People tend to overestimate how long something lasted. Why? Because they are processing time more. Finally it's slow motion mode. When dopamine levels are lower. They tend to underestimate time intervals. Let's remember back to the very beginning of the episode. What's going on in people with A.

And that's the prevalence of these so called fidget er toys or things that kids can do actively and repeatedly in order to move out some of their um underlying river Batory activity in their nervous system. So what you will find is that some kids with A. D. H. D.

But one thing that is somewhat surprising is that many people with A. D. H. D. Use or abuse cannabis you might think well why would they do that? Because I thought that a increase in dopamine is actually what's going to lead to heightened levels of attention and that's what these people and Children crave. Well it turns out that cannabis also increases dopamine transmission in the brain but because of the other chemicals it increases namely serotonin and some components of the cannabinoid and opioid system it creates that kind

Either daily or up to excuse me weekly or up to daily, what you find is that for people that have not been using cannabis at all or have only been using it for about two years, Their rates of eye blinks are much higher than people have been using it chronically for 10 years. In other words, people who be using cannabis for 10 years don't blink very often at all. Now cannabis has well known effects in depleting memory but it does seem to engage the focus and blinking system in a way that increases focus. So basically what I'm saying is marijuana seems to increase people's focus but then they can't remember what they were focusing on. Something I'd like to discuss just briefly is the so

In other words whether or not they can focus but it is absolutely wrong to think that the child that's getting up 11 times during a short six you know six minute interaction at the table or whether or not a child who somehow has to venture off every moment or a co worker of yours who's an adult who's constantly fidgeting and moving things around that somehow they are unaware that they are oblivious. They're not oblivious to how they feel, chances are they are very challenged in the situations that they're in and they're doing everything they can to try and regulate their attention.

The most convincing studies point to the fact that getting above 300 mg per day of D. H. A. Is really where you start to see the attentional effects. Now, fortunately if you're getting sufficient E.
