## Highlights
Because its goal is change, civic tech embodies an interesting split between demonstrating and operationalizing the potential of modern tech. I like to call these two branches showing what’s possible and doing what’s necessary. — location: [87](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZWMGMQ&location=87) ^ref-26387

I don’t know which strategic framework will work best for your situation, but I do know that if you don’t form strong partnerships with career staff and stakeholders, your efforts will fail. — location: [95](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZWMGMQ&location=95) ^ref-59439

The private-sector tech industry focuses on scale a great deal, but public institutions represent a different kind of scale. They affect people’s lives not just at enormous breadth, but over long stretches of time. Most of them operate in full awareness of this, seeing their role as one of stewardship of public goods (and public funds) rather than rapid innovation. With this different perspective on scale and time, we technologists have to earn our way to working on deeper layers of digital public infrastructure through steady and trustworthy partnership on surface-level projects. — location: [97](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZWMGMQ&location=97) ^ref-15193

the second major enabling point that civic technologists pushed on in the early days: if all government publications are in the public domain by default, shouldn’t all government-produced code be open-source by default and allow for public review and contribution? — location: [290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZWMGMQ&location=290) ^ref-39447

It’s probably quite important to note that my personal bias comes from that open source part of the space. My entry into open government movement intersects with my personal interests in public government and in my personal interest in open technology

Available scale is often in conflict with how directly you can see or measure outcomes. — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZWMGMQ&location=305) ^ref-17232

In general, the best thing to do if you have substantial privilege is to use it to support underrepresented colleagues and partners. — location: [486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZWMGMQ&location=486) ^ref-35918
