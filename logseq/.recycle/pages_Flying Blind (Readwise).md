	  Under soft-spoken finance chief Boyd Givan, Boeing had sought to keep cost data out of the hands of rank-and-file engineers, to keep the information from compromising their designs; now the opposite was true. Boeing wanted them all to make decisions with the cold eye of a Jack Welch or a Harry Stonecipher. After finishing the course, engineers were meant to “understand, God, that program has to be produceable, I can’t put every bell and whistle on it,” said Boeing’s vice president of learning, Steve Mercer, the former deputy at Crotonville.

	  Taking aim at financial metrics like RONA, Hart-Smith said the answer was not merely to dispose of assets. A far better response, he said, “would be to develop and sell new products that could be produced profitably with the same equipment and personnel.”

	  Clay Christensen, author of the influential piece about “skating to where the money will be”—had started having second thoughts about pushing business leaders to use rigorous financial metrics that encouraged conserving capital. With interest rates at historic lows, capital was now abundant. In a 2014 article called “The Capitalist’s Dilemma,” Christensen wrote that companies needed more “market-creating” innovations, not “efficiency” innovations, whose benefits lasted only a year or two and cost jobs. “Much as it pains us to say it, a lot of the blame for the capitalist’s dilemma rests with our great schools of business, including our own,” he wrote. “We’ve advanced success metrics that are at best superficial and at worst harmful.”

	  In the jobs I had—it was all about people, whether it was in production flight test, experimental flight test, in the training team. Does your finance person very clearly understand what it takes to run your piece of the business?”

	  “It’s systemic. It’s culture. It’s the fact that we have a senior leadership team that understand very little about the business and yet are driving us to certain objectives. Its [sic] lots of individual groups that aren’t working closely and being accountable…. Sometimes you have to let things fail big so that everyone can identify a problem.”

	  The Boeing deputy who’d vetted the software design had categorized the risk of a failure as relatively minor. But the documents on file reflected the software’s earlier design (Revision C), not the more powerful version later added in flight tests (Revision E). They showed the stabilizer had the capacity to adjust a plane’s ascent or descent by only 0.6 degrees—in its final form, it had been given the authority to make adjustments at four times that angle.

	  Their expectation that a pilot could safely untangle the chaos of confusing alerts and intervene to turn off the stabilizer had been challenged.

	  What most alarmed pilots was that this new feature overturned decades of Boeing design philosophy, the thing the manufacturer had always claimed set it apart from Airbus. “If it ain’t Boeing I ain’t going,” pilots would say, proud of the fact that a computer would never take the plane out of their hands. Now the colossus of American aviation was casually telling them it had done exactly that.

	  The MAX had a single cutout switch. If pilots flipped it, as directed in an emergency, they’d no longer be able to adjust the electric trim with the button under their thumbs. They’d have no choice but to use the manual trim wheel, the one that the deadheading third pilot had noticed was moving on its own the night before the Lion Air crash. That wasn’t easy. Pilots trained on moving the wheel in refresher courses once a year, but some went their whole careers without ever using it in flight

	  I think it is unconscionable that a manufacturer, the FAA, and the airlines would have pilots flying an airplane without adequately training, or even providing available resources and sufficient documentation to understand the highly complex systems that differentiate this aircraft from prior models,” one wrote. “The fact that this airplane requires such jury rigging to fly is a red flag. Now we know the systems employed are error prone—even if the pilots aren’t sure what those systems are, what redundancies are in place, and failure modes. I am left to wonder: what else don’t I know?”

	  answered, hewing to the script again. Bartiromo pressed: But was that information available to the pilots? “Yeah, that’s part of the training manual, it’s an existing procedure,” he said. “Oh, I see,” she said, apparently mollified.
	  MCAS, of course, wasn’t in the manual—not unless you counted the glossary, which defined the term but didn’t explain what it did. (The definition was likely a vestige of an earlier draft, before Mark Forkner convinced the FAA to delete a fuller description.)
