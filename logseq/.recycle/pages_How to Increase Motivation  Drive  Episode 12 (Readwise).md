	  Speaker 0: previous podcasts, or if you haven't no problem, epinephrine allows us to get into action. It stimulates changes in the blood vessels in the heart and the organs and tissues of the body that bias us for movement. And if you'd like to learn more about epinephrine, you

	  Speaker 1: about the fact that it feels so good that you want to do it over and over again. And that's because

	  Speaker 1: as you eat 
	  
	  Speaker 0: a piece of chocolate. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: Believe it or not, it tastes good. And then there's a shift away from activation of dopamine, and there are other chemicals that are released that trigger a low level 
	  
	  Speaker 0: sense of pain. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: Now you might not feel as physical pain, but the craving that you feel is both one part dopamine and one part the mirror image of dopamine, which is the pain or the craving for yet

	  Speaker 1: And so we can distinguish between dopamine, which is really about pleasure, and dopamine, which is really about motivation to pursue more in order to relief or exclude future pain. Let me repeat that dopamine 
	  
	  Speaker 0: isn't as much about pleasure as much as it is about
