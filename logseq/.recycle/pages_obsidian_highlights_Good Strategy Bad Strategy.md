## Highlights
The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action. — location: [241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=241) ^ref-12295

---
Or they may avoid hard choices because they do not wish to offend anyone—generating a bad strategy that tries to cover all the bases rather than focus resources and actions. — location: [253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=253) ^ref-29080

This is my tendency and the Mary Lee kennedy at NYPL problem.

---
Having a coherent strategy—one that coordinates policies and actions. A good strategy doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength through the coherence of its design. — location: [264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=264) ^ref-28599

---
Most organizations of any size don’t do this. Rather, they pursue multiple objectives that are unconnected with one another or, worse, that conflict with one another. — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=265) ^ref-33676

NYPL and CTF we’re like this

---
The creation of new strengths through subtle shifts in viewpoint. An insightful reframing of a competitive situation can create whole new patterns of advantage and weakness. The most powerful strategies arise from such game-changing insights. — location: [267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=267) ^ref-41808

---
A good strategy has coherence, coordinating actions, policies, and resources so as to accomplish an important end. — location: [282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=282) ^ref-22585

impressive. But everything we know about the PC business says that Apple cannot really push beyond a small niche position. The network effects are just too strong to upset the Wintel standard. So what are you trying to do in the longer term? What is the strategy?” He did not attack my argument. He didn’t agree with it, either. He just smiled and said, “I am going to wait for the next big thing.” — location: [333](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=333) ^ref-32062

an essential element of the U.S. Army’s “Plan A”—envelopment—is the illusion of a direct attack coupled with a much more massive end run. And, since “Plan A” was available to anyone with twenty-five dollars to send to the U.S. Government Printing Office,5 it remains puzzling as to why “Plan A” was a surprise—a surprise not only to Iraq but also to talking-head military commentators on television and to most of the U.S. Congress. The best answer to this puzzle is that the real surprise was that such a pure and focused strategy was actually implemented. Most complex organizations spread rather than concentrate resources, acting to placate and pay off internal and external interests. Thus, we are surprised when a complex organization, such as Apple or the U.S. Army, actually focuses its actions. Not because of secrecy, but because good strategy itself is unexpected. — location: [407](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=407) ^ref-55009

In the case of Desert Storm, the focus was much more than an intellectual step. Schwarzkopf had to suppress the ambitions and desires of the air force, marines, various army units, each coalition partner, and the political leadership in Washington. For example, the U.S. Army’s best light infantry—the Eighty-Second Airborne—was tasked with providing support to French armor and infantry, an assignment its leadership protested. Eight thousand U.S. Marines waited on ships to land on the beaches of Kuwait City, but did not. It was a diversion. Air force commanders wanted to demonstrate the value of strategic bombing—they believed that the war could be won by air attacks on Baghdad—and had to be forced against strenuous protest to divert their resources to fully support the land offensive. — location: [415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=415) ^ref-65454

---
most organizations will not create focused strategies. Instead, they will generate laundry lists of desirable outcomes and, at the same time, ignore the need for genuine competence in coordinating and focusing their resources. — location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=425) ^ref-61334

---
More than the deft wielding of power, the listener experiences the actual discovery of power in a situation—the creation or revelation of a decisive asymmetry. How someone can see what others have not, or what they have ignored, and thereby discover a pivotal objective and create an advantage, lies at the very edge of our understanding, something glimpsed only out of the corner of our minds. — location: [449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=449) ^ref-7153

Half of what alert participants learn in a strategy exercise is to consider the competition even when no one tells you to do it in advance. — location: [483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=483) ^ref-45858

---
Looking just at the actions of a winning firm, you see only part of the picture. Whenever an organization succeeds greatly, there is also, at the same time, either blocked or failed competition. — location: [484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=484) ^ref-11000

“By itself,” she says, “it doesn’t help that much. Kmart would have to move the data to distribution centers and suppliers. It would have to operate an integrated inbound logistics system.” “Good,” I say, and point out to everyone that Wal-Mart’s policies fit together—the bar codes, the integrated logistics, the frequent just-in-time deliveries, the large stores with low inventory—they are complements to one another, forming an integrated design. This whole design—structure, policies, and actions—is coherent. Each part of the design is shaped and specialized to the others. The pieces are not interchangeable parts. — location: [497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=497) ^ref-37715

---
Many competitors do not have much of a design, shaping each of their elements around some imagined “best practice” form. Others will have more coherence but will have aimed their designs at different purposes. — location: [501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=501) ^ref-19078

---
Copying elements of its strategy piecemeal, there will be little benefit. A competitor would have to adopt the whole design, not just a part of it. — location: [503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=503) ^ref-29386

it’s not a good idea. We couldn’t make a go of it alone. The Wal-Mart store needs to be part of the network.” I turn back the whiteboard and stand right next to the boxed principle: “A full-line discount store needs a population base of at least 100,000.” I repeat his phrase, “The Wal-Mart store needs to be part of the network,” while drawing a circle around the word “store.” Then I wait. With luck, someone will get it. As one student tries to articulate the discovery, others get it, and I sense a small avalanche of “ahas,” like a pot of corn kernels suddenly popping. It isn’t the store; it is the network of 150 stores. And the data flows and the management flows and a distribution hub. The network replaced the store. A regional network of 150 stores serves a population of millions! Walton didn’t break the conventional wisdom; he broke the old definition of a store. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=516) ^ref-13748

---
Store locations express the economics of the network, not just the pull of demand. — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=524) ^ref-28559

---
The individual store has little negotiating power—its options are limited. Most crucially, the network, not the store, became Wal-Mart’s basic unit of management. — location: [525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=525) ^ref-22961

---
oft-forgotten cost of decentralization is lost coordination across units. Stores that do not choose the same vendors or negotiate the same terms cannot benefit from an integrated network of data and transport. — location: [530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=530) ^ref-60335

---
once Walton’s insights made the decentralized structure a disadvantage, Kmart had a severe problem. A large organization may balk at adopting a new technique, but such change is manageable. But breaking with doctrine—with one’s basic philosophy—is — location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=533) ^ref-21380

the language of business strategy: identify your strengths and weaknesses, assess the opportunities and risks (your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses), and build on your strengths. But the power of that strategy derived from their discovery of a different way of viewing competitive advantage—a shift from thinking about pure military capability to one of looking for ways to impose asymmetric costs on an opponent. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=587) ^ref-24430

---
a much more effective way to compete—the discovery of hidden power in the situation. — location: [593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=593) ^ref-55542

When you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it. — location: [603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=603) ^ref-65220

“All too much of what is put forward as strategy is not. The basic problem is confusion between strategy and strategic goals.” — location: [628](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=628) ^ref-12249

But there was little guidance as to how to actually deal with the national security situation. At the center of these documents lay President George W. Bush’s dramatic new doctrine of responding to the threat of weapons of mass destruction with preventive war, if necessary. Yet there were no indications that this doctrine had been turned into a coherent strategy. That is, the conditions of its actual use to dissuade, deter, and intervene were not explored. Further, the problems created by this policy, and the competitive reactions to it, were not thought through. — location: [633](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=633) ^ref-56376

---
Bad strategy is long on goals and short on policy or action. It assumes that goals are all you need. It puts forward strategic objectives that are incoherent and, sometimes, totally impracticable. It uses high-sounding words and phrases to hide these failings. — location: [677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=677) ^ref-34302

---
A hallmark of true expertise and insight is making a complex subject understandable. A hallmark of mediocrity and bad strategy is unnecessary complexity—a flurry of fluff masking an absence of substance. — location: [736](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=736) ^ref-56961

---
A strategy is a way through a difficulty, an approach to overcoming an obstacle, a response to a challenge. If the challenge is not defined, it is difficult or impossible to assess the quality of the strategy. And if you cannot assess a strategy’s quality, you cannot reject a bad strategy or improve a good one. — location: [739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=739) ^ref-41048

---
If you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, you don’t have a strategy. Instead, you have either a stretch goal, a budget, or a list of things you wish would happen. — location: [763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=763) ^ref-26949

---
Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes. — location: [933](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=933) ^ref-34019

---
A good strategy defines a critical challenge. What is more, it builds a bridge between that challenge and action, between desire and immediate objectives that lie within grasp. Thus, the objectives a good strategy sets should stand a good chance of being accomplished, given existing resources and competence. — location: [945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=945) ^ref-51365

---
blue-sky objective is usually a simple restatement of the desired state of affairs or of the challenge. It skips over the annoying fact that no one has a clue as to how to get there. — location: [947](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=947) ^ref-57348

---
A leader may successfully identify the key challenge and propose an overall approach to dealing with the challenge. But if the consequent strategic objectives are blue sky, not much has been achieved. — location: [949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=949) ^ref-25328

---
If the leader’s strategic objectives are just as difficult to accomplish as the original challenge, there has been little value added by the strategy. — location: [951](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=951) ^ref-39947

---
When a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it sets the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons for the underperformance. Unless leadership offers a theory of why things haven’t worked in the past, or why the challenge is difficult, it is hard to generate good strategy. — location: [968](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=968) ^ref-64755

---
there is no diagnosis of the reasons that leadership is weak and expectations are low. A serious look at this issue would reveal that the high-priority schools had been failing for decades. — location: [975](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=975) ^ref-35771

A high rate of community involvement might be a very desirable state of affairs. But it is hardly a strategy. It is a blue-sky objective. Much of the underperformance in these thirty-four schools appears at kindergarten and deepens as students grow older. A principal cause of this underperformance is the poverty-stricken chaotic communities these schools serve. — location: [991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=991) ^ref-26920

bad strategy is the active avoidance of the hard work of crafting a good strategy. One common reason for choosing avoidance is the pain or difficulty of choice. — location: [1009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1009) ^ref-17826

Strategy involves focus and, therefore, choice. And choice means setting aside some goals in favor of others. When this hard work is not — location: [1016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1016) ^ref-16360

First, if one has a policy of resolving conflict by adopting all the options on the table, there will be no incentive for anyone to develop and sharpen their arguments in the first place. Only the prospect of choice inspires peoples’ best arguments about the pluses of their own proposals and the negatives of others’. — location: [1030](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1030) ^ref-39612

Perhaps the three could weight their preferences and one could somehow combine these weights. Economist Kenneth Arrow received a Nobel Prize in 1972 for proving that such attempts are fruitless.2 This sort of group irrationality is a central property of democratic voting, — location: [1045](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1045) ^ref-12358

It was a political outcome reached by individuals who, forced to reach a consensus, could not agree on which interests and concepts to forgo. So they avoided the hard work of choice, set nothing aside, hurt no interest groups or individual egos, but crippled the whole. — location: [1059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1059) ^ref-47747

---
Serious strategy work in an already successful organization may not take place until the wolf is at the door—or even until the wolf’s claws actually scratch on the floor—because good strategy is very hard work. — location: [1064](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1064) ^ref-9362

---
But the essential difficulty in creating strategy is not logical; it is choice itself. Strategy does not eliminate scarcity and its consequence—the necessity of choice. Strategy is scarcity’s child and to have a strategy, rather than vague aspirations, is to choose one path and eschew others. — location: [1070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1070) ^ref-16142

---
There is difficult psychological, political, and organizational work in saying “no” to whole worlds of hopes, dreams, and aspirations. When a strategy works, we tend to remember what was accomplished, not the possibilities that were painfully set aside. — location: [1072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1072) ^ref-12613

to a common type of bad strategy. The path starts with the recognition that truly inspirational leaders—ranging from Moses to Churchill to Gandhi to Martin Luther King Jr.—occupy a different space than leaders who draw authority from birth or organizational rank. — location: [1108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1108) ^ref-46062

The idea of charismatic leadership dates back to Max Weber — location: [1111](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1111) ^ref-38247

As long as strategy remained at the level of intent and concept, the conflicts among various values and between the organization and the initiative remained tolerable. It was the imperative of action that forced a decision about which issue was actually the most important. — location: [1524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1524) ^ref-38278
