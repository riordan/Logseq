	  good. A broad swathe of society actually believes that the concept of a guarantee has merit (that merely promising without guarantee is somehow shirking responsibility). In fact, unless one has access to irresistable force and infinite speed, there are no guarantees.

	  philosophers have muddled the idea of promises with the notions of obligation and morality. What caught our attention early on was that promises are an independent and simpler idea than obligations: something suitable for engineers.

	  CFEngine. The word promise seemed a good fit for what I needed: a kind of atom for intent that, when combined, could represent a maintainable policy

	  Perhaps the most important thing about Promise Theory is that it drives people to the most terrible puns, without realizing that those puns say something involuntarily insightful, too.

	  The first thing we notice is that some agent (a person or robot) has to make the promise, so we know who is the active agent, and that by making the promise, this agent is accepting the responsibility for it.

	  Cooperation usually involves dialogue and incentive. What is missing from these promises is a counterpart like: I promise to pay you if the bowls are clean. Thus a promise viewpoint leads to a question: how do we document incentives?

	  Commands and other impositions fail us in two ways: they tell something how to behave instead of what we want (i.e., they document the process rather than the outcome), and they force you to follow an entire recipe of steps before you can even know what the intention was.

	  Promising the end state is independent of your current state of affairs

	  Promises also express intent from a viewpoint of maximum certainty. Promises apply to you (self) — the agent making them

	  But promises represent ongoing, persistent states, where commands cannot. They describe continuity

	  Note that a behaviour does not have to be explicitely intended for it to be intentional. It only needs to be something that could be intended or has the appearance of being intended.

	  When we make a promise, we want to communicate to someone that they will be able to verify some intended outcome.

	  Usually a promise is about an outcome that has yet to happen (e.g., “I promise to get you to the church on time for your wedding”). We can also promise things that have already happened, where it is the verification that has yet to happen (e.g., if your accounts department says, “I promise that I paid the bill on time”); the outcome has already happened, but the promisee has not yet verified the claim.

	  In fact, every possible observer, privy to relevant information, always gets to make an independent assessment of whether a promise was kept or not. The promisee might be the one especially affected by the promise outcome, but is not the only one who can form an opinion.

	  This idea, that each autonomous agent has its own independent view, means that agents form expectations independently, too. This, in turn, allows them to make judgements without waiting to verify outcomes.

	  A simple expression of intent is what we call a promise proposal. By telling it like you mean it, it becomes a promise.
