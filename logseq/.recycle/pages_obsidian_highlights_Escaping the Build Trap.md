## Highlights
I soon realized that it was not just the product managers that were stuck in the build trap, but the entire organization. Solving the processes for the team was not enough. It was about setting up the entire company to support good product management. — location: [102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07K3QBWG1&location=102) ^ref-61975

Now we had two groups of people — existing users and new users — both with the same problem. They were not finding the classes they wanted on the site, and there were not enough to justify them staying for longer than six months. — location: [1506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07K3QBWG1&location=1506) ^ref-47646

The Product Kata helps product people form incredibly impactful habits. Doing it over and over again, exactly like a martial arts kata, ingrains the process in your brain. After practicing for a while, this pattern of thought becomes second nature. — location: [1536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07K3QBWG1&location=1536) ^ref-39552

One or all of these might be what it takes to get us to the successful outcome of the initiative, and that’s okay. To determine whether we are getting closer to achieving our product initiative, we need to break the success metrics into something we can measure on a shorter time scale. We call this the team goal, and it’s how we measure the success of the option. Although it can take six months or longer to reach the product initiative goal, the team goal should be something we can measure after every release, which gives us feedback that our option is working the way we want it to. We set the team goal with the same process as we did for the product initiative. — location: [1546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07K3QBWG1&location=1546) ^ref-36650

After we have set the goal, we begin walking through the Product Kata. We ask ourselves the following: What is the goal? Where are we now in relation to that goal? What is the biggest problem or obstacle standing in the way of me reaching that goal? How do I try to solve that problem? What do I expect to happen (hypothesis)? What actually happened, and what did we learn? We do answer questions one through four to figure out how to plan our next move as a team. — location: [1555](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07K3QBWG1&location=1555) ^ref-52901

It’s important to understand each phase so that we are doing just enough to get us to the goal. One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen in product management is teams rushing in to apply a tool or practice at the wrong stage. Many times, they are experimenting unnecessarily when the problem is not yet known or when there is already a good idea about the solution. — location: [1561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07K3QBWG1&location=1561) ^ref-17771
