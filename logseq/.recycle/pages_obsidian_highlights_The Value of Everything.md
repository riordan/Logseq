## Highlights
This book questions the stories we are being told about who the wealth creators are in modern-day capitalism, stories about which activities are productive as opposed to unproductive, and thus where value creation comes from. — location: [134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01NBQMXPT&location=134) ^ref-63303

These stories are everywhere. The contexts may differ–finance, big pharma or big tech–but the self-descriptions are similar: I am a particularly productive member of the economy, my activities create wealth, I take big ‘risks’, and so I deserve a higher income than people who simply benefit from the spillovers of this activity. But what if, in the end, these descriptions are simply just stories? — location: [137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01NBQMXPT&location=137) ^ref-39947

They call it value creation but, as in the financial sector itself, the reality is often the opposite: value extraction. — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01NBQMXPT&location=172) ^ref-50985
