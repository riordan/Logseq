	  Substack, Spotify, and Clubhouse’s current perspective on content moderation mirror how Twitter, Facebook, and Google once viewed the practice. Twitter executives initially called themselves “the free speech wing of the free speech party.” Facebook insisted it had no business touching political content.

	  As unelected businesspeople, the big platform executives once felt queasy about deciding what people could say on their services. They also, pragmatically, wanted nothing to do with the political fights that could erupt after every decision. While they had power over people’s ability to speak, they preferred not to use it.

	  The trolling caused its core users to leave, according to a post by then-CEO Dick Costolo on an internal forum in 2015. “We suck at dealing with abuse,” Costolo said. He promised to do better, then left the company.

	  If Twitter did nothing, it also risked the ire of the entire entertainment industry. “Very rarely do celebrities engage in these kind of conversations directly with Twitter executives,” a former Twitter employee with knowledge of high-level discussions told me. The individual asked to remain anonymous due to confidentiality agreements. “Very large agencies like CAA or WME say we’re going to tell all of our people to not do anything more on Twitter, to switch all of their activities over to Instagram, if you don’t take some sort of action.”

	  After the Jones episode, Twitter effectively killed its hands off approach. It banned Milo Yiannopoulos, the troll it saw as a ringleader of the harassment.

	  By the time Covid hit, the big platforms’ reticence to remove and label posts had largely evaporated. And when the extent of the plague became clear, they set assertive policies. Facebook prohibited posts that contradicted the WHO’s guidelines.

	  Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube started removing posts that threatened elections’ integrity, adding a new type of content they’d moderate enthusiastically along with targeted harassment.

	  Clubhouse, which didn’t respond to a request for comment, has since added user controls like a block button and an option to report abusive behavior. But the reporting functionality — which includes options to report content under categories like “discrimination or hateful conduct” — doesn’t seem to be doing much.

	  Clubhouse’s tentative moderation approach might reflect the ideological reticence that Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube displayed in their early days. It may also reflect a unique business problem. As smaller platforms take off and fill with content, the cost to moderate can be overwhelming.

	  “That’s why you see so much emphasis on automation,” the former Twitter employee said. “Taken to its logical conclusion, you could have a full federal jobs program moderating content on a platform like Facebook or Twitter.”

	  “It’s very important for Rogan to demonstrate to the people in Spotify trying to control his content — and clearly there is movement inside Spotify to do that — to push back against that,” said Greenwald, a recent Rogan guest. “Put on the person who’s probably most horrifying to you, just to show you that you have no power to control me.”

	  Public pressure, it’s worth noting, has influenced Spotify’s content decisions in the past, including when it removed R. Kelly from playlists in 2018 after sexual assault allegations. Spotify backtracked on the move after an outcry.
