## Highlights
Paul espoused his foundational sine qua non of excellence and urged us to use it. It started with a simple trilogy of questions that every person in an organization should be able to answer affirmatively every day, without reservation: ●            Am I treated with dignity and respect by everyone I encounter without regard to race, gender, rank, educational attainment, or any other distinguishing feature? ●            Am I given the tools, training, resources, encouragement, etc., to make a contribution to the organization that adds meaning to my life? ●            Am I recognized for that contribution by someone whose opinion matters to me? — location: [37](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08FXRY7QD&location=37) ^ref-24517

Tapping into the human aspiration to excel, challenging ourselves to be the best in the world at everything we do.
