Now, why am I making this distinction? I mean, first of all, I'm not the one to first make this distinction. Others have made the distinction between identity versus immediate goal based habit formation. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: But the reason I'm making the distinction is that pretty soon in our discussion today, we're going to 
	  
	  Speaker 0: talk about dopamine molecule 
	  
	  Speaker 1: that's associated 
	  
	  Speaker 0: with motivation and reward that we make in our brain

	  Speaker 0: a term that you're going to find in the formal neurobiological literature or even psychological literature. It's frankly a term that I 
	  
	  Speaker 1: coined to encompass 
	  
	  Speaker 0: a number of different pieces of the psychology and neuroscience literature. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: Limbic friction is 
	  
	  Speaker 0: a shorthand way that I 
	  
	  Speaker 1: use to describe the strain that's required in order to overcome one of two states within your body. One state is one of anxiousness where you're really anxious and therefore you can't calm down, you can't 
	  
	  Speaker 0: relax and therefore you can't engage in some particular activity or thought pattern that you would like. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: The other state is one in which you're feeling too tired or lazy or 
	  
	  Speaker 0: not motivated. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: Both of those

	  Speaker 1: act as sort of a seesaw. You're either alert or calm, you're either asleep 
	  
	  Speaker 0: or stressed. Those two states are not compatible with one another. You've probably heard of wired and tired, but that's really once you've been very stressed for a long time To the point where you're exhausted, What does the autonomic nervous system have 
	  
	  Speaker 1: to do with any of this. Well limbic friction is a phrase that can be used to describe how much effort, how much activation energy you

	  Speaker 1: they also make a lot 
	  
	  Speaker 0: of other habits easier to execute. Things like being alert for work, things like making sure that I get good sleep the night before, things like hydration, things like making sure that I eat the foods that are better for me than maybe some of the other foods that I would more reflexively reach too if I weren't doing that training. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: So certain habits act as linchpins, meaning that they shift a lot of other

	  Speaker 1: What I'd like us to do at this point is to take that concept of limbic friction, and for you to ask yourself 
	  
	  Speaker 0: what habits you perform on a daily basis. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: And these could be things as basic as brushing your teeth before breakfast or brushing your teeth after breakfast. It could be 
	  
	  Speaker 0: uh for instance that you get exercise or you get it at a particular time of day 
	  
	  Speaker 1: or even that you take a particular route to work right where we are very habitual and we tend to do things more or less over and over in the same 
	  
	  Speaker 0: way unless we intervene in ourselves. That's just the way that we are wired. So

	  Speaker 1: It involves dividing the 24 hour days 
	  
	  Speaker 0: Into what I call three phases. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: The first is Phase one, which is 0-8 
	  
	  Speaker 0: hours after waking up Approximately. Okay, you can put a plus or -30 minutes on this for yourself. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: The second phase is the 9 to 14, maybe 15

	  Speaker 0: hours after waking 
	  
	  Speaker 1: up. So we've taken the 24 hour cycle. We've carved it up into three phases phase one, phase two and phase three. Now everything I'm describing, or at least the way 
	  
	  Speaker 0: I'm going to describe it is based on what I would call a typical schedule diurnal schedule we've heard of nocturnal, well we are diurnal, most of us are asleep at night

And in doing so, set up this task bracketing system so that the individual habits that you're learning or that you're trying to learn to have a much greater probability of being executed and consolidated, meaning that pretty soon they will just
