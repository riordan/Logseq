	- "can't even have a meaningful conversation about what's going on at that side of the company"
- [[Newsletters]]: hard knowing whats going on in [[Salesforce]] vs whats going on in [[bigquery]]
	- is this table in BQ; does that have the same logic as the data extension. Who knows, where's that knowledge existing?
		- been a lot of basic source of truth stuff. Is this the table? which is the better one to use. If ashleys looking in the SF UI and its different, where's there a breakdown?
		- Hard to identify where its working and its not, and not many people have knowledge in SF where its happening.
	- "Highly engaged reader" = someone who opens % of emails within a certain period: segmentation metric. started being used as a baseline; strictly open-based.
