## [[Subscriber data warehouse]]
- ABC Report, Now AAM Report
	- Section tied to you can count someone as a subscriber if they access the digital product for every day they access it
	- Auditers are looking for the list of every person who made up this number
		- e.g. all 5k people of this day with this unique ID
		- What they're looking for is: The subscription status of a user and what their product is at that time.
			- we still don't know how to do these things because the data's in a poor state
	- Been building toward this narrow use case of retention reporting, but there's a ton of foundational stuff that should be getting built in the middle with retention at the end
- Subscriber data
	- marketing partners
		- Mara and James (who's james?)
		- Àö

### Note to [[Toan Dang]]
Figured we could talk more about this on Friday, but wanted to give you a heads up:

So this Subscriber Data thing is becoming a big thing fast. The short version is: without an agreed-upon way to define our subscriber data, Marketing's blocked mission-critical projects (4, I believe), we can't compute major Company Strategy KPIs or retention, and now there's a finance audit thing that'd have to be driven by the same data.

Seems like Mark, Daniel, Jim and others have tried to address this before, but it always stalled out. They'd discover one more thing, need to involve another person from outside the existing effort, and stakeholders got pulled away to too many other things to validate since it was taking so long.

I'm thinking that if we can put a dedicated popup team together for a few weeks consisting of the folks we'd need to solve this end-to-end, we can break the logjam and have an MVP out in a few weeks. This would break through the blockers and have a base to scaffold the rest of the subscriber data products off of out of Data Engineering, while making the most efficient use of the time from the systems, engineering, and finance folks. But to do that, it'd mean those key participants would be focused almost exclusively on tackling subscriber data for a few weeks as a part of this popup team and that other work would need to be depiroritized. 

From our conversation on this last month, it sound like for this to work it'd need the deep involvement of both @Jen Mcgroarty and @jimanton. I've yet to talk to either of them about this beyond the broad problem statement. I know that the approach of a popup team is a bit unorthodox and before I develop this further or broach this with them, I wanted to run the general approach by you first. And to see if you wanted to help with this

So I wanted to get your thoughts on an approach I'm thinking of taking to address this:

We put a dedicated, short-term popup team together for a few weeks. It consists of the folks we'd need to solve this end-to-end, with the goal of breaking the logjam and having an MVP that we can scaffold company-wide subscriber data usecases off of. It would run for 5-8 weeks. This would break through the blockers and have a base to scaffold the rest of the subscriber data products off of out of Data Engineering, while making the most efficient use of the time from the systems, engineering, and finance folks. But to do that, it'd mean those key participants would be focused almost exclusively on tackling subscriber data for a few weeks. Almost certainly this'd need to involve 

I'd love your thoughts on the approach. How do you think this will go over with folks? Who do you think would need to be involved? How do you think we should try to kick something like this off?
