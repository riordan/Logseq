- [[Dream Journal]]
	- you had a kind of major dream so far tonight. this is intende as a way to commuhicate your dream feelings and memories to the present moment of interpretation:
	- remember the night at the place back on Newell st where you used a tennis ball to roll out your back for the first time and it made you physically feel better. tonight was that for your mind.
		- Remember the time you used to be the guy who was kinda life of the party?
		- Goofed around, made people laugh, used to be the life of the party? ate wingsw and drank beer and cooked streak
		- Remembered to do what he said he was going to do? Knew how to do what he said he would do. Stayed up to date with friends, who meant a lot to him? didn't draw lines in the sand over nothing and refuse to dcross them (especially just to feel like you're living up to w2hat your wife had said?)

		- Who wouldn't lash out irrationally at yourself. Who wouldn't be going to therapy four times a week.

		- Remember that you've bee3n a lot smalller in your presence than you know how2 to be. that you's pretty darn inspiring, not sad and shallow
			- last week you said you felt alone and alone. It's a cry for help but to whom/ Nobody can come save you but you. So this comes back to the synbology of that time before you you lef\t youfslef feel deflated all the damn time. It's time to go from the journey in and being a person who says can't all the time to a person who does what he says he's going to set his mind to.
		- You don't have to bring everyone else around you down. you don't have to always look onto the negatibve things and self conssciously degrade yourslef no matter what as shte sign of responsibility.
