# 0. Dayplan
## üå§ 1. **FILL OUT** Morning Journal
### What are you grateful for?
My wonderful kid. A foresighted boss. A loving wife.
### What do you want today's highlight to be?
Moving forward on Kickoff with Aaron.
### What are today's mantras
- Think it. Build it. Ship It. Tweak it.
- Better communication is planned.
### What's on your mind?
Lack of organization. I need to create more clarity for myself and my team.

That means:
1. For me. I know what I‚Äôm doing every day. I set myself up for success by making it easy to get back into what‚Äôs important. To do that requires unloading what‚Äôs in my head, organizing what I‚Äôve put down, and making it easy to recall. You‚Äôve been OK at recording. You need to get great at structured recall.
	1. Planning. Taking and using time to plan and organize. You know you do best when you think about what you‚Äôre going to say before you say it. Give yourself that gift; you cannot be afraid of it.
	2. Templates: Make it EASY to do the right thing.
	3. Organize your notes. Not in the moment, but right after it. Make it easy to clean what you‚Äôve touched today. Put everything back where it belongs.
	4. Write your project list and project descriptions. Even if it can‚Äôt happen now, it should be captured and placed in a share-able location.
2. For my team: Help them understand what‚Äôs important by helping them focus and prioritize.
	1. Context is not inherently helpful. Making context relatable is useful.
	2. Be reliable. Keep your word. Do what you say you‚Äôre going to do.
3. For my boss:
	1. Build a roadmap. Keep a roadmap.
	2. Own things.
4. For my colleagues:
	1. build a roadmap. Make it work with them. Make it work for them.
	2. Don‚Äôt agree to things you can‚Äôt do.
	3. Make structures that make it easy for them to find you and intercept with you.
	4. Elevate others. Show others work in the best light possible.
	5. Be reliable, be consistent, be accessible.
