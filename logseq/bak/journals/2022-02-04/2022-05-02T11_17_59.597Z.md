## MZ
- [[Newsroom Analytics]]
- Background:
		- Subprojects - nobody owning internal data products
		- nece3ssary to get content strategy project moving at speed needed
	- Change to see:
		- actually have a content strategy; for inquirer writ large and for individual desks
		- ad-hoc decisionmaking on a daily basis
		- Developing a broad framework for content and storytelling
		- Goal of content strategy:
			- Create an environment for reflection
			- Step 1: Train the trainer
	- Workshop 3-4 weeks from now:
		- brainstorm ideas for broad framework
		- "what is our content strategy"
		- "how do we make this thing work"
			- tooling very important there
			- lots of work on individual desk level or project level
		- Needs: goalsetting for whole project, tooling to measure success toward those
			- at micro and micro levels and throughout
			- Don't build the whole thing to proceed
- Tooling
	- need ot move quickly
	- indexes:
		- Useful:
			- where to invest, where to pull back
			- useful for IDing audiences within desks/teams
		- Not useful:
			- not really adopted in newsroom. Visibility
			- company metrics; different alignment of "conversion path" etc.
			- It's an index; useful on a per story basis, but obfuscates total realities
				- because indexized makes it hard to evaluate sum contributions of given person or desk because dividing by number of stories written
					- Want to see the "totality of the contribution"
				- Contributions obfuscated 2 ways:
					- everything's indexed to 100
					- Everything's on a per-story basis
					- Been an obfuscation of what's driving things that the index is contributing to
			- Desire to move more immediate and real-time
				- more responsive to yesterday
			- Who's it for: Not really the reporters
				- User group for analytics in the company is small
	- Priority use cases:
		- 1. Analysis and understanding
		- 2. Goal Tracking
		- 3. Hypothesis testing; analyze structured change
	- Primary problems: The analyst is building the tool
		- Daniel served as analyst, engineer, PM
		- As big a gap as any data gap. 
		- NEEDS to evolve with their plans and learning; not just in theory but in practice
		- 
### The Problem:
We don't have a content strategy. We have a bunch of small decisions, made ad-hoc on instincts every day from which we create The Inquirer. Desks aren't thinking long-term about being explicit about what they cover and how that ties into our goals to reach and resonate with new audiences.

Our first attempt to take what we measure for the newsroom and synthesize it into something more 



	- What's driving current needs?
	- What changes need to be driven?
	- Structural impediments to adoption in the past?
	- Process impediments to analytics developments in the past.
	- Useful vectors
- [[Business Performance Reviews]]
	- What are you looking to get out of these?
	- What makes a productive investagatory / direction change conversation for you?
		- hooks you grab onto for when somethings going wrong
		- Insights as to opportunities
	-
