- We're going to be moving a lot more monitoring over into Datadog.

- Content Strategy Data Needs:
	- #analytics Collab
	- scoping/planning out a bunch of the editorial data work with some of the recent direction/decisions
		- Recap of some of the discussion points
			- Discussion topics related to content strategy work:
			  GA4 real-time data capabilities
			  Potential partnership with Google News initiative
			  Task others with researching potential overlay and a/b testing alternatives
			  Improvements needed to article performance table (e.g. adding app traffic)
			  Subscriber interactions data or alternative habit metric, how best to look at on a desk or team level
			  How to track opens on daily newsroom analytics email (send through InkBox?)
			  Any more ideas to try to get daily report data ready by 8 ET rather than 930
			  Engaged time metric if we ditch Chartbeat
		- Background: Patrick is finalizing Content Strategy plans; work from Data & Insights to help make that happen: Goalsetting & Tracking
			- Output: how many stories they write | Performance: Conversions
			- DECISIONS:
				- Ending chartbeat
				  id:: 6287aea6-8fdc-48c7-b647-35530b924ca4
				- Ending Indexes
		- Targets:
			- 20% increase across the newsroom
				- This won't be uniform 20% across newsroom; some teams might be 30%, others 10
		- Needs:
			- Short-Term
			- Long-Term
				- ((6287aea6-8fdc-48c7-b647-35530b924ca4))
					- Figuring out if GA4 has good realtime
						- challenge: Realtime display viz layer
					- GTM-SS: Send clickstream data to an eventstore (Grafana, Spark, BigTable)
					- Parse.ly ([[Ross Maghielse]] and [[Patrick Kerkstra]] have concerns over this) - want a single source of realtime and batch data
		- Apparently some wire service traffic is not allowed to be search engine indexed
			- is a good faith effort to not make it show up in search; arc functionality to disable it kinda sorta doesn't work, but it's WaPo traffic
- [[Dan Kirchberger]]
	- Overwhelmed by positivity
	- Bad:
		- lack of subscriber data; help in that
			- Triaging that will be important
				- Paired w/ Kate and Mark on SF side
					- some data quality issues, but always will be
				- Rachel's onboarding work will have to do with subscriber data
					- Tons of additional touchpoints to be added; lots of those will happen on the Marketing tech stack side
					- How are we tracking the effectiveness of those behaviors seems up in the air
						- Lack of clarity about what data we're actually collecting vs what marketing has on Blueconic side
				- Bill Tevis's KPI reporting is FANTASTIC, but not individual
					- decomposing it
				- Darya for retention reporting
		- DSI circ system sync: Seattle times built print circ tools separate from circ / sf migration
