David Riordan  0:00  
And now it's recording a creepy video of us where we look like, Well, you look, you look great, but I look like a jerk. Um, but yeah, so the things that we would need to be doing then I think you're absolutely right. Our goals are to come out of the week with folks having a super clear understanding of what their individual what their individual roadmaps for the year will look like. And from those individual roadmaps, their goals, we want to use that as a chance for them to understand the context of our department strategy and our department roadmap, which we will be presenting to product as a whole at Pt any week. In order to do that, we need to have presented that to the team the week before that there's some level of grappling with it.

And some level of generalist consensus around it at a very high level. But then in terms of what PDE is, we use it to really, to reckon with those ideas, what does it mean to do this, for real. And as group leadership, we use that as a chance to understand where we need either contact like where the team needs additional context, where there needs to be additional alignment, or supports to make the work more effective in terms of like, how they do it, not just who they're doing it with or like a stakeholder buy in. If folks don't understand why something that we think could be important is important, that is a chance for us to see where we have failed to produce adequate context ahead of time to help people understand how they will be doing it and why they will be doing it.

And so for that to happen, it means that over the next two weeks, we need to have that sort of team strategy come together this week. Probably just like back to bullet points next week as slightly more formal slides, maybe a doc but probably not just whatever the the easiest way to get the ideas out will be like get the ideas out and put them in a somewhat formal way that can be like returned to incited and then facilitate and then design a workshop for the following week to lay that out to the team and start discussing it. And then also lay out the workshops for the following week where we actually talk about what are the biggest problems that we as analytics have what are the biggest problems that the company has that we are solving for? What are the biggest things that get in our way to doing them and then looking at the work that we are doing in light of how we are addressing those two classes of problems for the team and for the company

Unknown Speaker  3:18  
that sounds good are we gonna build on like some of this strategy stuff that we had done before? Like there were some high level things that was like pretty close.

David Riordan  3:26  
Yeah, I think we absolutely scaffold from that we scaffold from the

the OPR where is the these like the set of focus areas, creating only foundational data distribute data practices for the inquire building a modern data platform operating KPI metrics reporting its activities across the company, I would also add into that improving discoverability of data products across the company. So that people not only the KPIs but anything else that we are building that can be used to help answer questions is visible and it's like it's visible and used. It's not just that we've made it available but that it's getting the approach that we've chosen is getting adoption

Unknown Speaker  4:43  
we can track death dashboard usage.

David Riordan  4:46  
Yeah, that's exactly what it is. And, like perfect, disappoint. Um, yesterday. Todd asked like how articles, we publish them on average. And Julia used Daniel's content dashboard that is still beta and wasn't on the product like the analytics dashboard page to answer it. It's not formal because it's quote unquote, unicorn vomit. Sure. But like, it's experimental, it's still useful. How do we make the like, what the the surfaces of what we know, available to the company, and then use that as a way to drive people to trusted KPIs and trusted metrics and trusted dashboards as well as still being able to help answer questions. And then

Unknown Speaker  5:38  
we like, yeah, I yeah,

David Riordan  5:42  
I still think that this is probably the right overall approach. We just need a clear diagnosis of what the situational problem is. And then a couple of kind of key tactics that take these pillars and sort of show how they work together

Unknown Speaker  6:06  
do I'm

David Riordan  6:08  
okay, I'm gonna stop recording now. Oh, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  6:11  
Let's keep Yeah. So there's, they're like the pg&e week. There's, like, Becky talks about presenting some data stuff. I was thinking some of the subscriber engagement would be interesting to present. Patrick is also like begging for this Julie keeps asking me for it and like sweet, um, it's not quite ready yet. And I also like Margaret, who's been asking for this data for literally like
