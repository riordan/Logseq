# Reflection
## What did I learn today?
> I have not yet been assigned a task that has not upset someone on another team.

> You have to go all the way to the top to get out of the much. Good people skills don't fix this. 

We are proceeding all the time as if the volume of incidents that we encounter in any given project is business as usual.

We expect incidents, so we treat them as business as usual, so we don't fix it.
