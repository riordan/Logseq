	- [[Subscription Equity]] - lots of comments from the newsroom:
		- Bob Fernandez to Everyone (11:28 AM)
			- Do we know why the Inquirer penetration is a fraction of Boston, Minn. and Seattle? We really have not talked about how many people in the city can't afford our product. So how do we boost penetration with this economic fact?
		- John Duchneskie to Everyone (11:31 AM)
			- Boston and Seattle metro areas have a median household income of $94,000. Philly metro median is $74.500.
		- Zeynep Gunbay (she/her) to Everyone (11:34 AM)
			- I'm curious if we're considering looking into different revenue sources to make our journalism accessible to lower income households?
		- Devi Lockwood to Everyone (11:35 AM)
			- Do we have any digital subscription partnerships with schools / libraries?
		- Rachel Molenda (she/her) to Everyone (11:35 AM)
			- Washington Post gives employees gift subscriptions to give out.
		- Anna Orso to Everyone (11:35 AM)
			- It’s a huge problem that we write stories about low-income people and then ask them to subscribe in order to read about themselves.
		- Layla Jones to Everyone (11:35 AM)
			- Is a sliding scale, income-based or zip code-based subscription option realistic
		- Sabrina Vourvoulias to Everyone (11:36 AM)
			- Can we get foundation support or business sponsorship for subscriptions?
		- Rachel Molenda (she/her) to Everyone (11:37 AM)
			- Salt Lake Tribune in SLC had a partnership with public libraries to give unmetered access from within all libraries.
		- Ben Burke (he/him) to Everyone (11:59 AM)
			- Did some math regarding income and Market Penetration as followup to Bob Fernandez and Anna Orso’s earlier points. Our paper costs $325/yr, compared to the Philly median income this is 0.68% of yearly income. Same calculation for Boston at $206.18/yr is 0.26%, Seattle at $214.49/yr is 0.21%. How can we claim that our marketing isn’t strong enough when our paper is 57.6% more expensive in real dollars, and over triple the price of other papers when compared to median income?
