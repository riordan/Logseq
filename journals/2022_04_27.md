	- [[Eva von Weltin]] #meeting/1:1
	- [[Marketing]] #meeting/weekly
		- The Numbers:
			- Traffic down; impacting bottom line
				- Increase in intercepts & starts (good premium content conversions from hardwall test)
				- Visits are way down vs budget
			- Starts are up due to 50% hardwall test
				- directmail starts up too
			- Jump in newsletter list
				- in SF if you sign up for any newsletter, you were considered a registered user
					- e.g. if signed up for sports daily, also got morning newsletter
					- Now has smoothed off
		- Bracket Jawn Retro
			- Different goals for different groups:
			- Successful in engaging contestants, but didn't bring new contestants in
				- Users who used it used it a lot, but not many played
			- 53% of submissions were driven by marketing (last touchpoint = marketing)
				- digital ads drove 0 submissions
				- paid search was ok
			- E-Edition email was very valuable: Far more people get that than the other newsletters
