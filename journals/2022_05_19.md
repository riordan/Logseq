			- Name:

			- What is your Role in the Permutive Project?

			- What has been your previous experience with DMPs?
				- None directly; though the team has previously worked with the two prior DMPs here at the inquirer. The team saw a ton of potential from these DMPs for getting meaningful user data, but that never really got fully realized as we didn't have an active stakeholder, so these DMPs were ultimately never fully integrated and got discontinued.
