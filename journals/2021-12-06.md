### [[Matt Boggie]]
- Inquirer is striving to be high performing
	- obvious things will need fixing
	- Use this time to listen
	- First 6-months to a year will be obvious; don't go super ambitious yet


Tactical:
Stakeholders:

- Most important:
	- Team - Mark & Direct Reports
		- what's been frustrating
		- what they'd be good at that we haven't asked them to do yet
- Outside of data team:
	- Becky
	- Lydia - Ops
	- Pete - Revenue
	- Michael
		- Unorthodox position
		- Internal consultant - thrown on a project, asks hard questions
		- Lots of freedom to go where most needed, but can miss some of the nuance in teh problems he's trying to solve. Bias to simplify toward 1 thing needed to be done
			- eg each PM owned 1 metric, 1 person for increasing reach, 1 on depth. Led to difficulty to see how any one intervention can effect any one of those thigns at once
				- New reorientation toward user need or UX situation (eg reader experience, editorial, questions around revenue, data products, etc)


- Must-do projects list:
	- All data projects are top of "Should do" list [P1, not P0] - to give space to shape the list
	- Top of the list:
		- Data Catalogue
			- Key underpinning to work
			- where does everything live, what's sources of truth, where's it go
		- Data	warehouse strategy
		- Self service tools
		- Repoorting tools
- Challenge: figure out how to iterate this:
	- how to work on these and deliver incremental value while pushing big projects along
- "[[Metrics That Matter]]"
	- Lisa had her observation that everyone had their own metrics reporting notes and frameworks
	- building dashboards around key metrics that matter that everyone should be aware of all the time
		- Dashboards are now in place, BUT NOT UPDATED AUTOMATICALLY
		- haven't done good job at distributing access because data will always be out of date
- "There's a lot of data, but very little insight" - Elizabeth Sumaet - runs Ink Studio (brand studio)
	- from what base?; is this good, should I care
	- Insights and understanding missing from the using of data
		- most folks don't go to analysts for support
		- finding ways to use data

- Newsroom relations:
	- Julie on Product, Julia on Data side - PDE's liasons into newsroom
	- Ross - leads audience & programming team, Patrick - thinking strategically about storytelling
		- patrick wants more story types and product workflow on site
	- Jazmine Howard (not on matt's earlier list) - newsroom operations editor
		- everything from making photographers have everything, to  print redesign ([[Project Inky]])
			- Goal to redesign print in alignment with digital
				- Hermes - legacy print layout tool that's being retired
			- Redesign by Pentagram
			- started simultaneously to site redesign
			- Print process hadn't been thought through for years
				- phone numbers didn't connect
				- ads in magazine - which didn't exist
			- Aligning deadlines between print and digital
			- About to sign contracts for systems implementation. Moving to Indesign workflow. Roxin tool on top of InDesign (then can do most on the web)
				- pitched to editorial in Arc, then plop it ino print layout and feeds design



Budget:
- Grants from lenfest for new tooling
	- 100k


Decision Science:
- came from daniel being very good at what he does and in a growth oriented position
- had a gap around data communication (still have some gap)
	- Underlying issues with data collection pipelines and data frameworks (e.g. whats a pageview, what should count)
	- Failed to deliver on the support built
	- e.g. indexes around performance management in newsroom.
		- deeply custom, difficult to maintain, but Daniel never pushed back. Helped model it out and got patrick to a good place, but difficult to automate
- Took on a couple of projects around 3rd party platform strategies:
	- had a high level rubrick for partners like apple news, but never got to use it
	- Those conversations come up rarely
	- Drawback in Daniel and Mark/'s work tend to be - can identify what will be difficult about solving a then, then try to mitigate it before getting to the core. don't 80/20
		

### Ana catchup
- scaling newspaper project
	- piloting in 2 spanish language neighborhoods
	- english -> google translate -> annie cleans it up
- One desk might log things in a different way in arc
	- eg photo assignments don't get reflected in arc; they get reflected in airtable
	- assignments don't reflect swhat gets attached to a story


## Interesting Projects:
- [[Feed Logic]]: Business logic for composing and ordering story feeds using editorial curation, customer control, automation, and/or personalized techniques.
- KPIs
- Data platform
	- [Data Pipelines Video Talk](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/1765310470/Data+Pipelines)
