## [[Lydia Hamilton]] Intros
Lydia is head of Operations and came from WMF.

- Why the inquirer
- What's the most important thing you've learned about the place


- When joined: 
	- too many competing priorities
	- resourcing is off
	- too many things in flight at at a time
- started with what's most importt and what are the blockers
	- Decided to have a very intentional series of exercises to prioritize - been last few months
	- Multiple frameworks:
		- PICK analysis - 2x2 of High Value, Know how to proceed
			- ID all the projects proposed or in flight, then ran them through MOSCOW (Must, Should, Could, Will Not have)
	- Final culmination: Portfolio assessment
		- talking about how to cascade this with [[michael zimbalist]] and [[becky bowers]]
		- Says what's most important by division and how does it align to goals
	- Next steps: Must Do -> Project Management Funnel, which is to improve execution and delivery
		- have been augmenting PMO
			- note: got 50% of headcount ask
			- Created a full PMO career track
		- Staffing PMS based on:
			- in flight?
			- size? (have categorization framework for size)
			- Programs get a default PM
- As conversations with matt as we rack and stack list - that's the reason for the list
- Formal resourcing list
	- realistic picture of what can be delivered year over year
	- People and teams and who's actually on what
	- People and teams data inside the organization??


Lots of pockets of org that need data help:
- important to get lay of the land about where to start first
	- started with 30 day listening tour
	- insight report - 30 people in 30 days for operations
	- 


### Areas to loop each other in on 
## [[Inquirer Data Strategy]]

### Agenda:
- Discuss history engagements with Deloitte and GNI
- Overview of the contents and structure
- Plan to handoff

### Overview:
- roadmap to build out capabilities in service of the business
	- in service of the business has been a struggle
		- what are the needs, can't match up biz capabilities until you figure out what the company is trying to do stably
		- "data strategy can enable the biz strategy. But what's the biz strategy, clearly."
- Mix of challenges of org stakeholders and of the team at a tactical level
	- Confusion both with stakeholders and within analytics org
		- Now likely to be able to cut through this as a centralized team
- Structured around Deloitte whitepaper structure. Data activation and maturity for news organizations



- Struggle to get the data to the people
	- literacy problems and access problems with stakeholders
	- product side:
		- don't think about data or measurement of things
			- get brought in way too late to help
		- struggled with idea of testing and opttimization
		- marketing's gone from worst to best stakeholder
			- product's turned over a lot
		- - 'Newsroom worse off than thought about
			- julia's gone on talking tour and summarizing issues
			- taken a step back as a company priority
			- e.g. picked chartbeat over parsely
				- parsely was used and nobody uses chartbeat
					- maybe made mistake of not being opiknonated enough about chartbeat being trash
				- Parsely was intended to be a first line of easy to use
				- chartbeat used mostly by folks who use homepage. hard for historical data.
				- Numbers are AWLAYS different between these
					- Lots of trust of the data issues
					- indexes used in newsroom for performance management, powered by GA, but parsely close but different
					- 

### Questions:
- Why is data valuable to The Inquirer's business?
	- DIFFERENT FLAVORS FOR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ORG
		- different needs and capabilities
		- 3 tiers
			- consumer marketing: grow sub base
			- Ad sales: B2b data and relationships
			- newsrooms: content analytics
	- Dan:
		- data and information as decision support
			- strategy at exec team and tactical: data and information for humans
			- Optimization - a/b/ tests and optimized outcomes
			- user experience
- compliance and governance?
	- nonexistant
	- Mostly out of scope for data legislation
		- some gdpr work - shrink footprint tracking if in EU
		- CCPA - onetrust cookies and data / deletion 
			- we have challenges on data deletion side. But don't have great cataloging of email addresses
			- Problems with ETL system. We're not deleting form source systems.
			- onetrust just flags request as the thing
		- NOBODY IS FEELING THE PAIN AROUND COMPLIANCE
	- Lot of painpoints around discovery and access
		- analytics feels most of the pain around it; only bigquery users
			- knowing where do I go to get this information, as onboarding new users
			- more curated datsets for specific purposes
		- access to data usually through analytics team made dashboards
			- data studio training didn't take off because didn't 
			- Data studio isn't a bi tool, it's a warehousing tool
		- shadow data repositories
			- lots of dumping into excel and pivot tables; don't work with this much data
		- Newsroom data reporting team as stakeholders
			- rolling their own




## George
- Everybody's open, so people want to be engaged and happy and willing to share
	- 2 things to understand:
		- 1. got where we are based on decisions of where they were
	- Mark's got a great work ethic and also knows his limits

- Challenges:
	- industry challenges
	- inquirer has stability in leadership
		- investing in a martech manager; we know we have that issue, so we're making an investment in that
	- identifying things calls out issues in things:
		- data needs organization
		- some structure underneath, know some structure of where toget to; missing primary focus
	- Been at this set of pain points for a while.
	- lots of short term easy wins, but don't understand that it's just the start
		- e.g. in switchover to roxin - people should never think about tool, but the gboal
		- Low variance problems and looking at the "The data's telling us this" Daniel McNichol side of things
	- Insights side isn't inside of the team anywhere. Daniel was that but didn't have the underlying pieces to free him up to do that.
	- North stars:
		- someone just focused on insights
		- BUs can access and think through data without worrying about underlying
- looking at insights from different funnels but should be the same thing
	- eg finance has a lens and tools that htey use that are different from what sales uses, 

- We don't have a solution for data governance.
	- his team's involved in privacy issues
	- In governance because of disparate data sources and where they reside
		- Not enough focus on it
		- Need to clearly define and deliniate roles on
		- Have people who can and will do that, but need other structures in place to move on that
	- "tell me what you're giving me and how I can work with it"
		- will hear a lot but not what you need from partners
	- History of the analytics team was originally web analytics, but became a conglomeration over time


2022 focus: Security and identity
- Mostly within the organization at this point
	- Currently use Auth0, but only onsite, not for all events and different systems
- internal sso and MFA
	- the plant is a huge reason we had ActiveDirectory
	- NT4 powered plant's trace system
	- Removing dependencies on legacy systems


**The stick is missing**
- nobody at the peer level to say no
- nobody to push back and advocate for sensible thigns to drive alignment
