	  Meter abandonment notes:
	  
	  - Thought behind the meeting: there's only so much we can do w/ contextual data (topics, keywords) & with hundreds of thousands of paywall hits per week, this is something worth digging into
	  - Both blueconic and wunderkind have survey tools that we can leverage - beop is already integrated with permutive, Lauren to set up a meeting with them to discuss
	  - We can do things in a couple of different ways - offer a free article in exchange for a newletter sign up and/or survey answer
	  - Big questions: how do we get that data into permutive? How do we get people to self identify?
	  - Giftcards work well for abandonment but wunderkind ads can be intrusive
	  - Paywall abandonment trigger is not guaranteed - idea might be to ask for email at this point and/or that newsletter subscription
	  - Can be complicated if we want to un block an article and we might have to do it a stupid way (like on the button click), and we'd make it so you only get prompted for a survey once in a lifetime (assuming we have an identifier)
	  - Major hesitancy behind lengthening user journey - preference to have a one click, relevant and non intrusive survey question but difficulties with this surround user self identification
	  - Google surveys are very non intrusive, already being used by gannett and it's just a tag we add to the website, Claire to send screenshots/ info
