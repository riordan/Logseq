### Conversation / Meeting Notes
#### [[Zimbalist]] take 2
Follow up from [[2022-01-04#finalizing 2021 audience numbers targets for 2022 forecast]]

metrics that matter: meaningful distinction between dashboards vs reports
Move to intranet for centralized sources of truth


Finalizing goals:
- Audience targeting is one of the few hard numbers here
#### Office Hours:
- Mara:
	- wants subscriber data
	- wants to use it to model subscriber lifecycle and experience and target
	- Rachel's biggest priority is subscriber lifecycle modeling.
		- (who's rachel?)
		- Working with Laurie Dowling, [[Nicole Henninger]]
	- **a problem from marketing is someone wanted loyalty to drop subscriber direct mail for VALENTINES DAY with 3 weeks**
	- We have a huge project to understand subscriber lifecycle and want to make direct interventions in subscriber experience
- how can we create a synergy where liz is in marketing, analytics is diffuse, how can marketing get hooked in to help with some of that
#### Marketing Weekly
- Instrumentation broke for several things during break
	- Both from code regressions & instrumentation environment changes
	- "Can we exclude apple from our reporting and CTOR"
	- apple click to open rate
- We need aggressive alerting for when instrumentation breaks
#### [[Kim Rossmair Johnson]]
- 30 years at the company, 22 on data
- lost a ton of power since october
	- D2 marketing - email targeting and logging and reporting metrics
		- In october G2 went away because not keeping subscriber concierge. Email platform good, not great.
	- Salesforce Marketing Cloud - misconception - does email and sms - and have nothing for everything else:
		- Data pulls for:
			- Direct mail
			- Retention
			- Telemarketing
			- Reports for Finance - had unique information especially where subscriber concierge was concerned which was touchpoint to customers
	- Most reporting moved into Analytics team
		- If looking at an "active account" would also include folks who had their papers on hold
