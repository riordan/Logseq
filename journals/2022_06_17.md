	- [[LD]] says: we don't have a way to measure session depth in experiments
		- NOW Ask [[kate]] about if we have a way to evaluate these engagement metrics

	- ## [[Julia Haslinger]] 1:1
		- a bit meh
		- Lisa meeting
			- patrick wouldn't talk about conversions, baselining, goalsetting in there
				- she'd hoped patrick would be able to have all this done and could adapt for each team
					- in-dma traffic took longer to baseline than expected
						- traffic only goes back to february since we don't have team or storyform
						  id:: 62acc238-e71b-48e0-b0d2-e2d6e65a49ec
					- Need to deal with seasonality for sports team desk
						- ((62acc238-e71b-48e0-b0d2-e2d6e65a49ec))
			- [[experimentation]]
				- hasn't done, but gotten requests
				- Video has expressed most interest in experimentation
					- want to know where best place to place the video
						- should it be lead image?
						- should it be up high?
					- Just changed so video's no longer autoplay.
						- can get some from actual play amount
					- What video team asks is "how much time on page is spent watching video"; as of [[2022/06]]
				- Scroll depth is more useful than time
					- if we didn't have the AMP disclosure of who got all the way to the end of the article would be useful
					- Admap would absolutely impact those
				- Indicator of has this affected scroll depth is a good healthcheck for [[Ad Map 2.0]] for intra-page
	- ## Kate and [[experimentation]]
		- admap: can we do "a check" that nothing is getting harmed
