# üì∞ Meeting Log
## [[Internal Comms]] with [[Lindsay Grow]] and [[Becky Bowers]]
- Challenges around Google Slide templates
	- "Add the designs to these slides"
		- Can't show full page, can't show movement in design
		- lisa not fan of desktop and mobile in the same page together
		  
		  #nextsteps
- [ ] Get slide templates that are great for information communication we can steal from
- [ ] Jam session
## [[Metrics That Matter]]
need to build the catalog of metrics and datasets being collected
## [[Kate Connolly]]
- Feels like [[Analytics Team]] reports page is pretty comprehensive in terms of 85% org comprehensive
	- could probably use another go-around on ad-hoc reporting
	- For [[Analytics Team]] specifically
		- Lots of ad-hoc reports going out all the time, not exactly the place we want to manage that, but hard to manage search in datastudio. Might be a better catalog for internal
