# 📰 Meeting Log
# [[[Jen]]]  and salesforce
- simplifying business rules for print
- working on getting all the business rules in SF
	- working on getting all the digital subs from old platform migrated to SF
		- 40k, then migrating print subs to SF so they're billed from there
		- Now have a lot ofdata imported for those subscriptions - nightly sync to update SF from DSI
			- have the basics for print subs to target them for any marketing emails
	- Working with Marketing to build out subscirber journey
- "Until we are in one complete system. Until the billing is in SF that's currently in DSI, we will have the manual manipulation for what's going into DSI".
	- Valid STart to DSI Use case:
		- Print subscription comes through web checkout. Counts as a "Salesforce Skeleton" subscription IN SALESFORCE {START TRANSACTION DATE, EMAIL}
		- If an existing sub under that address exists in DSI (change queue from SF -> DSI)
		- CS gets an alert if change queue fails. CS investigates and matches business rules in both systems.
		- If there's already an account in DSI, gets set as a Service Restart in DSI. Finance now counts this as a Start. FINANCE NOW COUNTS THIS AS A PRINT START (origination of start event now comes from DSI)
		- Matchback process then goes into SF Sketleton account to put in correct DSI account number to sync them nightly at 11pm
	- Messy invalid start:
		- Customer already has subscriptin active AND register new sub via web checkout. FAILS
		- CS rep won't put a Start Transaction into DSI.
		- A Start Transaction is not put into DSI since it's not already activated. A Start Transaction is Invalidated (Need business rule to skip which are invalid)
		- If Finance is reporting on Starts and Stops from DSI, and others are from Salesforce, going to have an inconsistncy from those that are getting processed from DSI.
			- BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW TO EXCLUDE IT FROM SALESFORCE
	- People:
		- Castille, Jim Anton, new SF dev
## [[Tracy O'Rourke]]
- With Print, there's a cutoff so you can't make changes after a certain time
	- e.g. 2pm. If someone calls after 2pm can't make the change
	- With digital do you give them access to digital right away, but not the print?
	- There's so many rates
- LATER [ ] #task Talk to Lori (ing) in charge of CS - in charge of transactions on a customer account
  :LOGBOOK:
  CLOCK: [2022-06-26 Sun 15:15:31]--[2022-06-26 Sun 15:15:33] =>  00:00:02
  :END:
	- she's the one most invovled in CS workflows
	- she's the one doing the starts, giving the credits
- Jeff Cooney - FP&A
	- Used to be in charge of circ counting
	- Now transitioned back - now trying to learn the nuances as well
- Pain points:
	- whole delivery structure around print products
		- Physical delivery gets assigned to a route (zip -> route)
		- Route carrier has 150 subscriptions, who they deliver to everyone on the list
		- needs to be a link between data system and carrier system
		- Salesforce needs to send data back to DSI so papers can be delivered
			- when this happens SF and DSI may not be in sync
		- We pay carriers for delivery. Rates we pay carriers are in DSI too.
			- Challenge: marrying subscriber detail with event of paper delivery to calculate payment for carrier
		- Challenge: Deadline to make changes. because you have to order a print run with a certain number of papers and send out deliveries
- Most recent problems:
	- SF has most recent digital subscriber data. "gets slammed back into DSI"
	- e.g. if you make a billing change in SF (with REcurly). Recurly charges someone's CC for a digital subscriber. that info is shipped over to SF->DSI in a batch (daily?).
	- Early on, didn't have a lot of digital subscribers being charged by recurly. Now that's increasing on a daily or weekly basis. Takes DSI a long time for all those changes to update in DSI to get their bill corrected.
	- We would cut off the DSI billing info at 7pm, 2 hours after delivery begins from SF, but hasn't fully updated in DSI.
		- e.g. most new starts in SF, but some legacy in DSI haven't been transitioned over yet
			- If they haven't been transitioned over DSI's the billing system of record
		- IMPLICATION: DSI doesn't know they paid, so DSI then triggers a double-bill
- ISSUE: So many pricing levels
	- $0.10 increments. More than 150+ rate levels. For each of those you have to have a rate
	- Complicates deliveries too
	- Pricing structure potentially too complicated
	- CHALLENGE: For the folks who in DSI only, many of the reason these folks are only in DSI is that their rates in DSI are missing
- ISSUE: tried moving them over from DSI -> SF led to double charging
- Backstory on DSI:
	- Founder of DSI sold the company. The new company no longer supports. The founder of DSI is our consultant
	- "Bonus Day" = instant revenue helps out circulation revenue we're supporting
		- e.g. "thursday will be a bonus day". Be delivered to all sunday-only subscribers on a thursday
		- This is something the paper decides. Built into the billing structure.
		- When we have a bonus day, requires a TON of manual work to get it correct in the system.
			- When we have an issue with this, consultant has to patch the system, which means hand rectification by Tracy.
		- PAIN POINT: doing anything outside the system
			- e.g. daily+sunday = $8/wk for 8 weeks = 64 bill
				- once you're at zero, then bill you a week in advance
				- For revenue purposes want to do things outside the systtem = all manual, which messes with the paid-through date
			- e.g. Mather rate bump program - moving them up to $0.50 week
				- Bonus day + Mather moves them up a week, so expiring 3/25 instead of 4/1, but is billing them the wrong amount. (MESSING WITH SUBSCRIBER DATE)
				- Jim anton is the person who has to do bonus day; knows even more than her or lori
		- Salesforce not financial. DSI closes at a certain time. This is all the activity; this is the ending balance.
- Grace:
	- If you go to 0 we won't cut you off even if you're at a negative balance.
	- Different people have different grace requirements
		- We try to get people to pay in advance
		- 7 days before they expire, we send them a notice, e.g. if there's an issue with payment
			- You get 91 days, or 56 or 0 days that you get papers
			- You're getting free papers while you're on grace.
			- e.g. if you've stopped because you're on non-payment but start again wind up on a 0-grace offer.
			- Booking future revenue we might not collect. At some point we write off those balances.
			- "does marketing want to be extending offers to someone who's 8 weeks behind"
	- "if someone in finance wants to get grace info, it's what's our exposure here. I want new marketing hire of how to save people on grace to be able to extrapolate this data and target those folks with a differnet add or subscription type"
		- e.g. good subscribers, 0 grace but fine,
		- "We need ways to segment in meaningful actionable ways"  - give me the sunday onlys in this zip code
	- Have subscribers in our system but aren't our customers (WSJ, NYT)
## Jim Thompson
- Tales from the tour bus - mike judge animated 
  
  Pain points:
- ad-hoc requests
- Most days not spent in DSI anymore
	- recreated home delivery
	- 3 separate processes for home delivery - 1 for each carrier
- Manifest System - used to send to gannett for printing dailies - used to use for the printing planet
- 6-8 dbs on sql side, DSI side = oracle + oracle
- feeding mather
	- backend matching: DSI number, salesforce description name, offer, offerID to send back pricing recomendations
- Synchronex - big stupid windows PDA
- How to help:
	- Doesn't help if we train on DSI
	- NCS new circ system sounds amazing. Moving from DSI -> new circ system
	- Have support for new system and not just him learning ins and outs of it
