- Julia:
	- training and efficiency:
		- for content strategy not that many inputs; getting her things done on time or a day or two late
		- limited set of metrics
			- lots of things including near last-click already done
		- Don't know hot to get data engineer input on finding efficiencies
		-
		- Worried about things that won't be scheduled

			- Freelancer Analysis
			- Push alerts
				- want a reliable push dataset and not push as much as you can
			- Social Analysis - would be nice to do here and tickets exist
				- e.g. time of day posting - what ToD are people clicking what we post
				- Experiments about what happens if we stop posting to our brand FB
					- e.g. 30 a day -> 5 a day (better publishing cadence & timeline based on data)

				- We have no impact tracking at an organizational level
				- learned impact tracking from Lam Vo
				- Have nobody setting impact goals; want to do impact tracking for MPU
