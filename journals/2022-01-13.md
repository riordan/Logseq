### Product #strategy Roadmap on Day 7
[Doc Version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xYUQOm6H-_iRbcw_gmHedOqhX2wwm3roxopXV3h0iTA/edit)

2022: Always Philly  
Core performance metric: Achieve 60% DAU:WAU with growth audiences  
Need to ID the growth audiences - within the Philly area etc << need to chart these out with current user data, user testing and content strategy to create some personas  
How to be indispensable to those people of Philly and measure growth toward them  
Then create the product strategy, marketing/paywall strategy and content strategy (and ad strategy) that gets us all thereBut to do that, need to ID the leading metrics and across content, product and marketing decide on the goal and then roadmap to itThings that form habit  
Things that cause repeat visits  
Things that capitalize on newsYear 1 goal: grow audience, but not just any audience - study new volume and bucket readers in several ways to study them (find product-market fit), push toward registration   
Year 2 goal: accelerate digital subscription revenueBut first focus on that:  
Core product strategy: create touchpoints at top of funnel places to encourage new users to being to engage with an audience funnel* will require help from editorial  
Core marketing strategy: brand visibility that focuses not on who we are but on what we can do for people; encourage/incentivize readers to get Philly into their routine* will require help from product  
Core insights/research strategy: be able to ingest and study the new users to find trends in content consumption and platform. Start to ID personas  
Content strategy: within the bounds of maintaining the core ethical purpose, double down on reporting that gets people to come back over and over and build funnels in areas we see people converting* will require alignment with allI need to make sure there‚Äôs nothing about how our products are designed that would turn a reader off from this.Build immediate funnelsSO - I do not think that app should be the dev work prioritized this year aside from perhaps as one other vertical as a test.**When it comes to reader experience, I think the focus should be on top and middle of funnel enhancements and the goal should be volume based**What are those (not all!?  
TOOLING - Clearer SEO fields and tagging fields that force that as part of the newsroom production process  
STORYTELLING - Formats that begin to emerge as resonating with a top-to-middle funneler  
**ON-SITE MESSAGING (reader experience) - CTAs and other things driving deliberate action toward getting the newbies on for longer and more repeatedly**  
ANALYTICS AND TRACKING - Need to learn from these brand new people  
PROCESSES - How to layer in emerging audience insights and assumptionsMarketing should ask for the freedom to be creative with this:  
Day pass  
Gift subscriptions/refer a friend  
One free gift article  
Experiment with registration tactics - what are slight value-adds? (News quiz? :) )  
Swag (I know the food section did tote bags)  
And ‚Ä¶. Brand campaign on a strong brand platform  
How can we bring as many people to the platform deliberately and keep them there?^ prioritization of work related to testing the best tactics for this: A/B testing, research etc
### Should I pitch myself as strategy
Do the work first
## [[Matt Boggie]]
- Lenfest lab
	- [[Sarah Schmalbach]] at [[Lenfest Local Lab|Lenfest Lab]] aare having issues with their analytics provider. Would love to work with us more. Analysis decks from time to time, nlp on survey responses.
		- Current provider: [[Hero Digital]] #vendor ; would look to wind them down over the next few months
	- Shape of lab might be changing. "We have no business running a lab at Lenfest. We'll fund at current rate for first year"
		- [[Matt Boggie]] and [[Sarah Schmalbach]] had a Conversation w/ lisa on [[2022-01-11]]. Role of scaling != Lab, but it's the job of the business to scale.
	- How to do cheap upfront integration work to leverage existing platforms for longer-term success, so we have a pattern for how we do it and scale it
		- "Resentment cost of porting" from R&D --> Operations
		- just as hard or easy to wind down, but de-escalates scale challenge. Makes it easier to continue if you see it's owrking.
	- Next steps: moving Newsletters to newsroom so lab can do new investigations and experiments
	-
- Capacity planning:
	- How do we intake requests and communicate responses to requests
	- individuals analysts and engineers are taking longer than they ought to in responding because of underlyin flexibility or nonrepeatability of hte work
	- Long-term goal 9-12 months for consistency
	- **what to do**
		- seems to be a lot of clamor for subscribewr data
			- how do we carve it vertically?
				- build up retention model
				- subscriber lifecycle
				- ltv
			- "Here's a direction I'm interested in going: what do y'all think"
				- Partners for this: bill and mara are the right ones
					- [[Kim Rossmair Johnson]] is a good partner to "Yes, but first"
						- Backlog -> fast wins for her will keep her engaged
					- Team needs a vision to hang their work on - needs a product vision doc
## [[Lydia Hamilton]]
- Hoping for quick turnaround:
	- Need to have a regular assessment of business performance
		- Monthly [[Business Performance Reviews]]
			- Assess 2 departments every months so that every department is assessed 3x year.
			- Chance for CEO, CSO, CPTO to assess:
				- what's going on in every department,
				- status of commitments made
				- Metrics
				- Progress toward org goals
				-
		- Goal hwere:
			- present valuable information in ways that is well understood by people
		- Engagement Questions:
			- What's a meaningful dashboard to use for these?
				- There's dashboards that are always updated, there's decks that are getting updated for various reviews
					- something to get up and off the ground within a month or two
			- What's a meaningful presentation format to use
				- Use the same slides - don't give us bloat - restrict the content
- Deliverables:
	- 1x pass dashboard
	- Template for communication out
	- Feedback to capture actions in meeting - accountability to follow up
- Timeline:
	- notes:
		- need to shop the idea and wireframes around
		- MZ will have opinions
- \WMF:
	- 10 slides:
		- metrics
		- deliverables
		- ways to raise the flag - drilldowns - ways we ask you to report out on that
	- All slides public
- Do we make it public
	- rack-n-stack: was a massive lift to work through
