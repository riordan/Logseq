### #governance for [[Google Cloud]]
The Inquirer lacks acceptable governance for many of our technical systems, which both poses major operational risks, but whose biggest impediment is it slows us down and prevents us from smooth operations. Sounds boring and forgettable, yet when it's working well, it *should* be forgettable to those experiencing its effects, getting the hard parts of process out of the way and enabling practitioners to focus. Technical governance is the policies and process that we use to oversee and operate our various technical systems. Sometimes it's established ad-hoc, as in an employee being the first user of a new service and setting up the sharing permissions as they go, othertimes as policy reflected in documentation, while other times in the rules, code, and systems that run our systems.
