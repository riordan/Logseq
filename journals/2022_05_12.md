	- I love this explainer on how to use BERTopic so much! First of all it's a step by step walkthrough of how to use those super fancy transformer NLP models to find related & similar clusters of documents. Topic modeling was one of those hot NLP approaches about 10 years ago and helped power some of the large scale automated sifting tools used for huge document dumps like the Panama Papers. So it's super cool seeing how to update the approach with state of the art techniques. 
	  
	  But what I actually like most about the piece is how it goes into the methods in the middle: reducing the dimensionality of the data and creating clusters that can both be globally meaningful, and still be meaningfully subdivided (finding clusters in clusters).
	  
	  The combo of these techniques (UMAP and HDBSCAN) are super reusable. I first saw them a few years ago as a way to do interpretable segmentation: a data scientist could write a query, use a few out of the box techniques to turn the results into embedding, but then it facilitated a conversation between data scientists and user researchers to unpack and try to understand the segments (were there meaningful groupings or was it just noise, was
