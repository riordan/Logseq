### Meeting [[Zeynip Gunbay]]: Product Designer
- Joined the paper out of idealism for journalism -> freedom
	- Started off on ads team
		- Creating ads for local businesses that wanted to advertise in the paper
	- There's a lot of movement internally; different managers
- Press freedom
	- Don't do research:
		- Subscriptions: people don't pay for news subs, cheaper than spotify
		- we have coverage of content that isn't visible to communities aside from the subs;
		- possibluse ads to provide subsidy to prestige content
- Mather
	- folks parents subscribe and pay huge amounts as long-time subs
- She'd join brownbags run by Daniel and kate to understand data better
	- use data better to move toward serving customers rather than serving the business
- Research:
	- user-research channel doesn't go far enough
	- product design gets in front of lisa every 2 weeks; she's often surprised by research
		-
	- Requires a culture shift, and definately better than it used to be before
		- ORG HAS DOUBTS AND HYPOTHESES. USE THEM AS BLOCKERS RATHER THAN TESTING THEM. THE LOOP ON RESEARCH SEEMS NOT TO BE CLOSED
			- Run an experient, run a survey
			- "some people have concerns; should we change this"
	- Experimentation pushback from management: is that because of short term pressure and goals?
		- experimentation and testing long-term insights not just short term feature iteration. [[daypass]] project as a big long-term insight test through experiments?
		- Also did customization feature test in app in summer 2021
- folks struggle workign with elizabeth summit - vp of inq studios
- Ëš
