- # [[Retention Reporting]]
	- One of the prototype projects undertaken by Analytics was the [Retention Reporting Beta](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/f0ee48ed-3681-4b52-b6d2-d5f3dc2a7f46/page/MvgFC). This is one of [[Daniel McNichol]]'s culminating efforts with The Inquirer, building on work he and [[Jeremy Beha]] did together. The core logic that drives it is documented in [this query](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?d=misc_analytics&p=ga360-173318&t=TEMP_sf_nonapp_retention_reporting_4262021&page=table&project=inq-dataform-prod&ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sga360-173318!2smisc_analytics!3sTEMP_sf_nonapp_retention_reporting_4262021)
