			- [[Sarah Jarvis]]  Level of confidence behind recomendations = important to newsroom & analytics
			- [[Katherine Ruane]]: every article is scored
				- Could bucket for relative performance threshhold
			- [[Arvid Tchivzhel]]: Could do more explaining what's behind the model. Could expose more features and do training.

		- Talked to mike cost about getting her dad involved
			- Why haven't we gotten him involved in beforeâ€½
			- 2011: Remember USG migration; were on vacation and were on the shore

					- At start of the year had been dropping various business rules into a doc - things popping up
					- Know many not ever captured
					- Mix of ideal vs practical vs macguyvered
			- [[rachelc]] had previously been in Finance in [[megan]]'s role:
				- most of the things got pulled from [[DSI]] but others from [[Mario]] (MSSQL Report)
				- "Why do I need to go to 4 places to pull this report so they all even out"
			- "To be able to see our grace rules would be humungus."
				- "People thought all new starts would go thorugh salesforce", but anyone who does through vendors or CS goes through DSI; so we don't have an email address.

- # [[Retention Reporting]]
	- One of the prototype projects undertaken by Analytics was the [Retention Reporting Beta](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/f0ee48ed-3681-4b52-b6d2-d5f3dc2a7f46/page/MvgFC). This is one of [[Daniel McNichol]]'s culminating efforts with The Inquirer, building on work he and [[Jeremy Beha]] did together. The core logic that drives it is documented in [this query](((62845a9b-4735-43ee-b518-2894cdbfd700))).
	- We should use this to inform our data model for the Subscriber Data project.
	- Here's what it does:
		-
	- Caveats abound:
		- This only accounts for subscribers who "Originated" in Salesforce; so it's missing many of our digital subscribers who started before Salesforce came online.
