- Gaps in marketing tech stack
	- Blueconic
		- lifecycles feature - realtime data
		- ublock blocks blueconic
	- salesforce engagement studio
- others on adstack
	- nativo has own dedicates spots on pages and they don't run through google ad manager
	- blueconic also in that categorization
	  
	  optimization:
- staffing for analytics and marketing
- big focus on subscriber stuff for q1
	- "do we already have this information somewhere"
- Platform-wise to focus on blueconic
	- haven't integrated a ton of things into salesforce to focus on yet
		- slower cycletime for integration between salesforce and blueconic
		- didn't have rsources in maketing for tackling what blueconic was offering
