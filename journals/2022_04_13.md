			- Notes
				- Capture Targets
					- What do we capture now
						- Email: Associated with site registration, associated with newsletter registration
						- Approach: Light registration, then incrementally add via surveys over time
							- Get first/last with most, but not all
							- Looking to add SSO to [[Wunderkind]]
							- Names help to do personalization
					- What do we add to capture over next several months
						- Approach: Light registration, then incrementally add via surveys over time
							- Periodic process to add incremental profile data over time
							- Value exchange; different for subscribers, nonsubscribers, newsletter readers
								- FT asks for Job Title & Income on signup
									- FT = very B2b
					- Long-term
				- Challenges
					- Infrastructure
						- Centralizing profiles for surveys
						- Integrated profiles low maturity: new data project will need to be spun up between Data & Martech
				- Action items:
					- LATER Document new project on [[Progressive Data Profiling]]
						- LATER Brief [[Matt]]
						- LATER Brief [[Brian Waligorski]] and [[Mark]]
					- LATER Discuss [[Progressive Data Profiling]] plans with [[Nadya Tan]] [[2022/04/14]]

				- Select criteria for:
					- What qualifies a project for inclusion in a Data PROGRAM with the PMO?
						- new data infrastructure that’s required for delivery of another project (eg not iterating on existing features)
						- Instrumentation of existing
						- examples
							- Progressive user profiling infrastructure for first party data (required for [[dmp]], useful for enriching  [[ subscriber profiles]] in [[Blueconic]])
							- It is important that if we are building a piece of infrastructure specifically for a particular project that is already been identified that the data group be in charge of the design and delivery of that component of the system so that it actually can be reusable and it’s not over fit through the needs of that one particular project but actually has multiple identified downstream beneficiaries. We want to make sure that this is not just a single it is either extremely well contained or if it will require long-term operational maintenance is designed for long-term stewardship
					- What component or feature would disqualify a data related effort from being included in a Data PROGRAM with the PMO?
						- Additional incremental instrumentation of existing data source
				- Begin to flesh out the criteria for three classes of projects:
					- Platform Infrastructure:
						- New Data infrastructure:
					- Data Products:
						- Making reusable tools out of data analyses
					- Insight Delivery
						- Default not in PMO
					- Data Activation:
						- Using data to drive individual frontline business actions in a fully automated or data-augmented way (e.g. personalization)
						- Examples:
							- Upcoming:
								- Personalize meter limit to each visitor based on the liklihood that they will subscribe. (Current [[Piano]] project). This requires building a decision-making engine that gets the same data for creating the approach as is used at decision-time (ML Feature pipelines), tools to monitor End-to-end pipelines for repeatable training, serving, monitoring of
