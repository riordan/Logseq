# üì∞ Meeting Log
## [[Sarah Jarvis]] [[Subscriber Acquisition Marketing]]
- mostly subscreiber acquistion, but do a bit of
- Day to day:
	- campaign performance tracking (on and offsite)
		- emails
	- UX of site
		- offers landing page
		- Subscribe button test for conversions (instead of a link)
		- Paywall design update + checkout page
		- All the assets nonsub interact with
	- Doing tons of tests
		- Low propernsity to subscribe = present an email reg
	- Team:
		- Her, Michelle, [[Liz Grace]]
			- [[Liz Grace]] designing all the tests and reporting
				- Going out on maternity at end of March
					- might be reaching out to Analytics to see what that looks like
					- Registration tests will be happening
		- Acquisition = just Sarah; lots of excecutional blocking now
			- need to be parallelized, hiring for a deputy now
			- After then will tap into [[Analytics Team]]
- What were table stakes:
	- gap w/ subscribers
	- Have Subscription Marketing Dashboard <- in it every day
		- her biggest resource in terms of acquisition
	- harder when have tests:
		- Things can't use existing dashboards to track. Takes more time to figure out how reporting will work

	- aim to own everything acquisition related
	- More detailed for marketing actionable facets for acquisition
	- one centralized dashboard for everything tied to subscriber acquisition (nothing retention related)
	- some metrics broken out by user level; some at session level
		- Bill tevis' world reports out on session level, Marketing cares at user level
- Working w/ Kate on this
	- now moving to SF Phase 2 but had been blocked until now
- Her comfort areas:
	- Mostly GA
	- Could do SF, needs to do e-edition reporting, but it's been in salesforce and integrated
