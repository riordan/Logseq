- [[Kate Connolly]] 1:1
  collapsed:: true
	- mark's been kicking ass talking to [[megan angren]] and capturing things in [[calculated dimensions]]
	- Kate getting into nitty gritty relationships between tagbles
		- Ton of duplication across a lot of the datasets
		- Blanks, missing data in some places, but show up in other places (e.g. addresses)
		- Rabbithole w/ [[Jen]] for IDing primary contact
			- Which field matters: Discovering on a field-by-field basis
				- "Business Accounts: I think we have a flag for that"
		- Eye opening how a lot of the [[calculated dimensions]] are being used
			- Some intuitive; some learning the field being used for the thing
		-
	- Mark & kate communication to Jim and Jen
		- Hadn't been communicating clearly to SF team:
		- it was "How does this fit" rather than "what's the best way to xyz"
		- Would daily standup help here? Yes, but need to very very clear.
		- Terminology & how we're talking about things. Some disconnect: intentional and specific about those things
	- lack of clarity
		- SF Terminology (and relatilonships)
		- Project definition (definition of done)
		- Not clear where endpoints are (e.g. Megan reports leading to other reports; don't know what each is doing for each stakeholder)
			- Eg. megan pulling reports together, but not sure what these reports do, and no way for kate to go from undersanding that 1;1 to the team doing it
