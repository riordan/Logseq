	- Lets talk about killing #DSI
		- "It's like a guardian knot"
		- Looked into the cost of eliminating bonus days.
			- At the outset, salesforce project was overtaken by the percieved requirement that it'd replace DSI. Including doing all of the "cookie billing" we do out of DSI, which itself is a hack in DSI
			- Slowed SF implementation
			- No strong project management to say how to solve problems, rather how to replicate in SF
			- Investigation
				- Did a massive look into what [[Bonus Day]] would cost us; each bonus day is an incremental $1m in revenue
				- Way we price print is market pricing; every consumer = different price, which DSI does well; continuous price increases on a schedule. This is the #mather price increases
					- [[mather]] takes feed out of dsi, takes a group to get churn rate to get price increase threshholds to get incremental churn related to price. We tolerate an increase in churn if it's profitable.
						- We increase about 20%; net increase of about 16%, leading to some churn
						- [[customer service]] gets wound in; sees current price, previous price, mather price and can revert to previous price
						- now have price floors
				- [[customer service]] service screen workflows
					- e.g. [[vacation stops]]. Rolls back dates if on vacation, rolls forward if
				- prints out manifest: where the drivers go to drop off the papers: dynamic TSP
					- DSI has route information for delivery
			- for print:
				- no more bonus days
				- [[Floor rates]] we can't go below (no more 0.99 sundays they kept forever)
				- SHOULD have all new digital subscribers being handled out of Salesforce
				-
		- What it means:
			- Pricing data is only an issue for legacy subscribers
			- Where do I drop off the paper today (routes and manifests)
			- legacy billing and legacy #cs
		- #[[Pete Doucette]] knows a lot about #DSI : Boston Globe uses it
			- Mineapolis star tribune got #DSI functionality working entirely out of salesforce
		- We need to figure out how who the people on legacy [[bonus day]] infrastructure and where they are. If equally distributed thorughout footprint, but if concentrated in certain geographies could be easier to isolate them for delivery instructions
