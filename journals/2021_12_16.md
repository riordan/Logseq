###  [[Engineering Systems#[[2021-12-16#Inquirer Engineering Systems Overview]] with [[Toan Dang]]]]
### [[Subscriber data warehouse]] and [[retention data]] status / overview
#### Attendees:
- [[Kate Connolly]]
- [[Mark Loomis]]
- [[Daniel McNichol]]
- [[Brian Waligorski]]
#### Agenda: Tactical knowledge transfer for Daniel's work on these projects
- Turnover session to review latest status & docs on
	- [Subscriber Data Warehousing] (https://inquirer.atlassian.net/l/c/kXiw9oDm) & [project](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/1772552239/Subscription+Data+Warehouse+Project)
	- [Data validation efforts](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/l/c/FBhZ2RNZ)
	- [Notes, caveats, business logic etc docs](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/1018101850/Salesforce+Big+Query+Dataset+Data+Migration+Documentation#Data-notes%2C-caveats%2C-query-patterns%2C-etc)
	- R[etention Reporting](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/1285783868/Retention+Reporting)Â as priority workload re: these dependencies
#### Notes:
- This work started under Nat (ex analyst) and Jeremy (ex backend data data engineering)
	- person responsible for SF data modeling hasn't been replaced. Still an open function
- Been a long slog to get to core data points & validate data quality for what's a subscriber, and whats retention
	- "pretty close on the digital"
		- need finance to share their numbers to validate
		- data notes
- Caveats: Subscription Start & Stop Data: Can't use transaction data, but use a
- Backstory: Had been planning on using SF for single source of truth for print & digital, but then never got print aligned in SF. Projects then decided to focus on the digital side for validation.
	- NOTE: even digital side was still a grab bag. JUST got to parity on digital subscriber count in the last few weeks. Jeremy (then Jim Anton) didn't QA the data when loaded in regarding circulation data. .
		- Salesforce devs focused on system functionality, not data quality.
		- MTM what happended: Didn't have data, wasn't valid or complete, and things were changing on biz side, leadership side, MZ changing his mind with the seasons
		- Validation was: getting parity and reproducing business logic, whether it was right or not
			- Historically never responsible for subscriber reporting; finance did it. so [[Analytics Team]] didn't have the knowledge to pull
			- SALESFORCE EINSTEIN has reporting that might be identical to this that. [[Analytics Team]] had ZERO visibility into this. It's a reporting source, and people are using it.
				- We might not even know how the canonical finance reporting is being done. It might be coming from there
				- Jeremy had been maaging Einstein reporting but when he left we lost that visibility into the effort./
	- Split systems are still a thing for business reasons for billing rules which can't be abandoned for financial reasons.
- Subscriber activity data: Joining by Auth0 = UUID for subscribers
	- Pretty good shape, but usually compared to our set of our "active subscribers"
		- Activity (good) / Active Subscribers (hard)
			- SF #subscription data still at the heart of the problem
				- How can you talk about "Monthly subscription data" if you have different start/stop dates for different subscribers.
	- some edge cases for biz logic (mark has this)
		- sometimes has different things like google account-> Auth0 UUID
		- #question do we know if Auth0 + google account share a UUID if a user binds a GA to their AuthID? (Google | Apple) -> Add email = what's the UUID
	- Would LIKE to push this to Salesforce but haven't yet
	- We can do it ourselves:
		- what are we capturing on FE and how's it being stored in SF
		- Edge cases around social sign-ons
	- Historical edge cases: This can change over time in how we were capturing from data sources
	- Web, Mobile App, E-Edition, Auth0, GA digital subscriber UUID
		-
- Edge cases:
	- Challenges to get trust: Finance sees granualr bad data and freaks out (e.g. 6/150k subs)
	  
	  Retention:
- Still a PoC powering a dashboard for Finance where they download to Excel.
- [This page](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/1285783868/Retention+Reporting) is our exposures, but all built for specific edge cases
  
  
  Asks on retention project:
- Confirmation of prioritization
- Project support
	- Support on coordination to get different groups onboard so analysts can focus on validation component
- Full requirements of a subscriber data warehouse need to
### Sarah [[Lenfest Local Lab|Lenfest Lab]]
- kid: 2 year old, ollie (he/him)
- analytics brings up trauma
	- numbers don't bring depth and nuance to thinking
		- shared definitions
		- exposure to this 10 years ago at inq
			- sales team used comstore and newsroom used omniture and nobody could get on the same terms, and nobdy gave access to shared numbers
				- "thats when I learned about role-based permissions in analytics tools"
				- business rules for permission-based access to data
		- Inq4All - Audit:
			- Dashboard that Daniel put together about who wrote what stories and desks and subtopics and homepage play, reporters on desk ratio: SHOULD that info be given to the newsroom without context and without framing that it was a subset of a subset of stories from a subset of an interesting time in journalism about which that people will make assumptions about themselves and others.
			- "Wouldn't be responsible to share with the newsroom... at least not in a dynamic form."
				- If given time: snapshots from dashboard with right level of context and data to reduce the risk of misinterpretation
		- "JIM VARMAN would have a definition of subscriber and lisa will probably agree with that"
- working in a lab that has a scoped notion of what success looks like in a qual/quant way
- Gap in leadership around analytics:
	- gaps in instrumentation & collection and data lake
	- long-term around insights, but that's hard
- Opportunities and gaps:
	- Her lab:
		- Gaps:
			- Linking product work to business outcomes
				- tends to get lumped together into "viability / usefulness of a product" -> Subscriptions / Advertising
				- New products & new business models (eg newsletter donations)
					- eg donations to save local news vs a subscription to inquirer
					- That requires conversations with folks who oversee business models
					- Finance wouldn't do P&L projections: didn't feel like would have that support
					- Assumptions that getting insights about a community at a granual level
						- how to justify spend on team
		- Strategic projects around engagement:
			- Jameel, Yaya Horne, others in newsroom getting together to talk about strategic engagement
				- eg price work
				- Not a lot of work to build new business models around new products
				- **how do we make full content products that aren't the full inquirer that open up more business opportunity in the region**
					- Product strategy and pricing strategy that can be informed by DEI is a place that can occur and be taken seriously
- She's talked to [[Mark Loomis]] about aligning around success frameworks for projects
	- hardest one yet around west kensington and [...] newsletters
- The reporters index needs an assessment. We have a habit of rolling out a program and assuming it's going to keep working. But what effect is it having on morale, effectiveness, insights? Maybe it is, but maybe 10% makes people feel like shit
- Source diversity tracking audit:
	- want to work with us
- Knowledge sharing touchpoints
	- meet with [[Newsletter Squad]] biweekly
	- try to join group product syncs
	- not real conversational touchpoints: just preseinting
	  
	  
	  Followups:
- Source diversity tracking recomendations; talk to someone in analytics and see if there's anyone to followup with
- Success frameworks - alignment and knowledge sharing
- Mapping tool - geographic equity analysis

	  id:: 6292422d-ff34-4bfe-84ce-9ca8acfd10f2
	  collapsed:: true
		- Been thinking about supporting testing program through this
		- OVERLOADED ROLE around both data programs and platform
		- Was a challenge to get buy-in for need of this
			- Been 5 months: WAS A CHALLENGE TO CONVINCE MATT
			- Hisotrically might have been what director of analytics might do, but not the great way for this to operate
	- Analyst roles
		- skills long term
			- Mostly an R shop now
				- Some ETLs
				- Forecasting
				- Ad-hoc data analysis
			- Level of analysis hasn't required it; can mostly do it in SQL
		- Can't really do fuzzy matching or data cleaning in SQL - would need those capabilities
	- We have an offshore python dev who's written stitch taps and has been underutilized since jeremy left

## Reflections
	- ### What's going on with [[Metrics That Matter]]?:
	  Metrics that Matter started out as a small project to set actionable KPIs that could align work and create shared understanding across The Inquirer. The effort became increasingly ambitious as the potential impact was understood, slowing delivery of these metrics in a way that they could be integrated into operations or planning. This lack of adoption meant we couldn't iterate on the project with customers, increasing their relevancy and usefulness as foks use them and help us improve the metrics, relevant segments and analysis tools, and integration into different teams.
