- Note to dan re newsletter:
  collapsed:: true
	- Hey Dan,
	  
	  Apologies for the delay in responding on the newsletter requests.
- [[Bill Tevis]]
	- his workflow
		- Megan's process + 90 dashboards we have
		- Lift from way it's downloaded -> way he needs it
		- Data Studio Reports:
			- **FTI Model Reports**
				- - [[Loomis]] built custom
				- came from Pete in FTI
				- Gives everything in one huge dump
				- WEB:
					- Key aspects: Paywall sessions, stops, starts
						- full breakdown of funnel
						- additional breakouts of start by conversion channel, promo code, mobile app starts, and subscriptions
						- #challenge Our funnel number doesn't have full transaction count (not from transactions), but SF + DSI does
							- initially analytics had more starts than in transactional systems;
							- Applies our conversion channel attribution + unallocated
						-
				- AMP
					- same as above but with AMP breakout
				- Downloads each of these into Excel then builds in a weekly basis
			- **Week-by-week dashboards (category)**
				- retrofitting existing dashboards to have a table and run for a period of a week
			- **Premium Content Dashboard**
				- Evolved from wednesday meeting
				- Downloads individual article performance table (including ID to track against Mather)
				- #gripes To get number of premium articles published a week, need to pick the ones with published dates. Wants an additional Premium, Released In This Date Window
				- Some weirdness with Titles and Unicode encoding; has to do a bunch of find&replace before using
			- **Newsletters**
				- Lot of users for this
				- he used to use lots of sections, but now has new process
				- Extracts from Individual Sends table and manipulates himself
					- Process:
						- Filters out Welcome NL (welcome sends)
						- Usually have to manually filter out
				- Devin & Kim pull out the Data Extension, which is a lot higher than what actually goes out (including blocked sends)
					- Ashley hoffman was using the higher number of blocked to report to lisa
				- #gripes newsletters can easily get conflated with Must REad / News Alert sends that can inflate the number
			- **Registration Squad Dashboard**
				- Biggest gap in reporting today: Registration sources & channels
					- Checkouts vs comments
				- `registration_source` field: most is null (99%)
				- Like the breakdown (google, apple, sso)
			- **Paid Media**
				- Pulling directly from Facebook & Google
				- Google Ads:
					- Don't currently have breakdown of starts
					- Don't know anything about the 28 Starts who came through this channel; what offer did we give them, rate, channel
					- Need a last inbound source + conversion surface
			- **Apple App Data**
				- Apple: 200 Level of data reporting doesn't provide level of detail neede
				- Same with Google Play ()
