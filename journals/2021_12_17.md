# Inquirer
## Reference Documents
## Meeting Notes
### [[Patrick Kerkstra]] First 1-on-1
- atomized in the newsroom 215 people
	- teams in different places
		- There are teams business models we'll move away from
			- hard to get folks onboard with their own planned obsolescence. "15% of the room doesn't include me in 10 years"
		- some more "we've done things this way"
		- Frustration with colleagues not along with the plan
- Still have a generalist bundle: geography
	- "Impact journalism for the inquirer"
		- bad at sticking with the story and measuring results over time; which we need not do intertnally
- Missing big questions: don't have our arms around the tradeoffs that we're making
	- accessibility, reach, scale vs subscription mandate
	- comes back to the politics
		- need to accep tthe fact that decisions to boost one thign won't comproise another; expect growth as we drop meeter, go more premium, drop out of FB instant, it's droping our pageview readership
- "not good at understanding compounding decisions"
	- see each call as a 1-off, and think about potential negative impact of that one thing, but usually focus on upside, but don't think about the compounding qualities of thesxe decisions
		- we remove comments, drop instant, go premium only - do all independent, but not looking at cumulative impact of it all. Might be 3,6, months apart, 1 year, but its a march in a continuous direction. it's compounding. we don't visualize that
		- less singleminded in our understanding of what might drive revenue growth
- communities and engagement desk spinup.
	- 2 story a week / 2 story a month model won't do much inroads
	- without a different mdoel for that content, you doom it to die in 6-12 monthjs since it won't survive the current business model
		- maybe remove that from the paywall; not premium content (what's ads monetization)
		- community newsletters
		- Events
		- sms / community orgs
		- potholes fixed service journalism
		- **NOT BEHIND A PAYWALL AFTER 2 STORIES A MONTH**
	- SUBSCRIPTION ACQUISITION = LONG TERM
		- Is there a philantropic revenue model for that work. Could foundations support keep that investment going. Keep it alive long enough to find out if it would work.
	- Lenfest grants go from capacity bursts to underwriting operations pretty quickly. More baked into the balance sheet
	- My focus:
		- lack of understanding of what our framework is, what our metrics are, what we're working for is a meaningful impediment to us working together (newsroom + biz). Poisions trust and undermines informed decisionmaking
		-
### Pete - chief revenue officer
- all the revenue: b2b or B2C
- prior: Management consulting TMT, Boston Globe Subscription Revenue division
	- In consulting: built sustainable local media business model
		- could have a digital business 2x business that's mostly subs + some ads + other revenue
		- based around traditional bundle
		-
- Here: People process and technology to get us moving forward
	- strategy:
		- scaling digital subscription business
		- Migrating print readers to sunday + digital: Accelerate this existing transition (big revenue driver of future model) #godeeper
		- Grow audience
			- deepen audience engagement levels
			- greater audience intelligence (e.g. first party data)
				- Audience data -> accelerate ad business (where there are data gaps today)
				- Reimagine ad business
	- BELIEF:
		- FIRST PARTY DATA MORE VALUABLE
		- Can't compete on scale; geographic affinity
		- Signals not demographic: more behavorial or psychographical
			- trying to crack code on non-subscribers and newsletter readers
				- Newsletters = early step in engagement cycle
- Newsroom angle: Service is great, but how do we scale it?
	- robot journalism for real estate listings
	- followups with:
		- [x] #task bill tevis followup ✅ 2021-12-27
		- [x] #task lauren amato followup ✅ 2022-01-26

### [[Subscriber data warehouse]] alignment for #print


Attendees:

Goal: Getting print subscriber data into salesforce
- background: needed for 2022 planning
- need to understand where things are, what needs to be unblocked, and how can it head in the right direction
	- Analytics desires: Usability for stakeholders
	- Critical for retention reporting. Reporting is easy, but making it analysis friendly is hard
- QUESTION: Do we need to prioritize getting the data over reporting right now?
	- subscriber data warehouse
### Zimbalist
- whole purpose of [[Metrics That Matter]] was to stop analytics from spinning its wheels
	- stop people working on newsletter templates working on sponsorship goals
		- should be able to work on sponsorship but not who and how
		- stop thinking about incremental pageviews driven by newsletters
	- GET OFF THE OVER-COMPLICATED DASHBOARDS AND SPREADSHEETS
	- NEVER HAD A PM OR PMO
	- It's a slogan not a project
	- trust the metrics, that allow you to see your impact and evaluate it
- Need to understand internal customer needs
	- marketing needs as much access to raw data as they can; highly data literate
	- ads needs more nicole insights work at the moment + fundamental data engineering
		- data engineering around Naviga (Ad CRM): Need reporting automated for reports they think they need -> reports they actually need
		- Knowledge support that is continuous over time
		  **	- [[[Subscriber data warehouse]] Subscriber challenge isn't a problem definition problem, it's a systems reconcilliation problem!** #takeaway
- MTM redefinition
	- A few major KPI's
	- Metrics framework at a small level that we scale out:
		- Newsletters as a pilot slice
- 2 segments: Subscribers and nonsubscribers; 2 products: newsletters for subscribers vs nonsubscribers
	- decent newsletter dashboard
- Newsletters as a segment:
	- has an org goal it ladders up to: number of newsletters in our database
	- requires absolute collaboration of editorial, marketing, product, sales (to some extent)
	- needs a strategy for subs (retention) and non-subs (acquisition)
- major newsletter called Clout: insider local politics blog
	- loyal readership, 2500k newsletters, high open rate: lets make it subscriber only
### [[Metrics That Matter]]
- now company KPIs:
	- [[Mark Loomis]] understands from analytics and [[Todd Gillespe]]
- needs to be decomposed and tractable
- Org goal status:
	- stood up a dashboard that gets updated "when people decide to". Nobody's using it
		- e.g. DEI uses their own charts
	- Some active work on org goals for 2022
		- Good shape except for some subscriber & engagement components
	- What do we do with those numbers? Dashboard? Decomposed dataset?
- Editorial Metrics
	- Started editorial metrics collection effort, but not using it to manage
		- produce high level things and needed more granularity to make it more actionable
		- Don't know if newsroom thinks they should/shouldn't be going down this
	- Digital editorial wants to know should The Indexes reflect the MTM?
		- is intent-to-order too complicated of a metric to explain to the newsroom
- Daniel: no real concrete of expectations of people in the organization of a particular thing that will be delivered.
- Freeing of expectations of top down setting what matters now
	- need top down and bottom up together
		- ![[Pasted image 20211217154344.png]]
	- NEED to meet in the middle with outcome based planning
	- **Do in a tactical initiative-by-initiative way**, OPERATIONAL METRICS THERE
	- This project has been top down and there's been a ton of work happening bottom up which is why there's no coherence
- Group needs aound whats next:
	- marketing has their own numbers - not much needed
	- ads needs a bit
	- newsroom needs most help.
		- newsroom hardest to connect bottom and top
		- MZ has content strategy project
		- NEWSROOM BEEN MOST WILLING, ENGAGED GROUP AT THE LEADERSHIP LEVEL
	- Approach in splitting
		- Company strategy: Metrics reporting that we all share. Common numbers and common charts
		- Pilot Project basis: Tool for driving decisions, seeking guidance, and understanding granular decisions / behaviors (decomposition).
- Newsroom:
	- [[Patrick Kerkstra]]doesn't want to use the indexes right now
		- black reporters are doing the work to reach subscribers who are key to the organization. Metrics not mapping into the DEI goals and leading editors to make decisions counter to DEI efforts.
		  
		  Decisions:
- Sunset project status of Metrics that Matter
- Continue org goal work for aligned KPIs
	- Followup with michael about quarterly org goals dashboard for performance review
	- Build and Run org-wide dashboards for Key Metrics aligned to company goals to build shared awareness and capability within data team
- Seek a partner project with which to pilot holistic decisionmaking tools for a key cross-functional initiative
- Newsroom metrics that matter: 
  
  Lot of stakeholders
