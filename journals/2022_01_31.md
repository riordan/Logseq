# üì∞ Meeting Log
## Mark 1:1
- [[The Indexes]]
	- Was very "beat" focused
		- With Covid, everyone reassigned, so "beat" wasn't relevant to the content folks were writing.
		- Wasn't fair from a DEI standpoint:
			- hiring reporters to breakthrough to new audiences. Were penalized since it was harder to attract.
				- Metrics showed reporters as responsible even when they were doing what their managers were asking for
				- Bad for reporter demographics
			- Audience attribution
				- Race: might be useful at a macro level, but down to reporter by zipcode would require a TON of validation.
				- Previous iterations had Age and Gender, which was provided by Google
## Subscriber Lifecycle Data Connect
Attendees:
- Mara
- Lindsay Deutch
- Purpose:
	- Subscriber Lifecycle sessions have data gatps that need to be brought in the room. Then have strategy drive from there. Instead doing "Outcome Mapping" in abstract terms and hasn't been going terriffic.
- "What kind of questions do we need to ask to get data more foregrounded"
	- approaching the problem wrong - so data can't answer the question. happenening as if data isn't a part of it. Purely mission and vision kind of way
	  
	  **The Problem:** Marketing is doing a big push for direct mail, especially as it relates to
- DONE [x] #task Writeup for Marketing Subscriber Mailing Problem ‚úÖ 2022-02-23
## [[Analytics Team]]
### DevDay: Mark - Google Analytics Serverside

The upside:
- Sets cookies serverside - lasts 2 years rather than 7 days

			- Mature rate 6 at months of tenure $5.49/week
		- Churn dependent on offering and time of year
			- Churn vs incremental churn

			- 3-4% of digital subscriber churn/month
		- SLIDE

		- What to gate to users:
			- SLIDE
				- ![[Pasted image 20220131162347.png]]

			-
	- DEI Representation
		- SLIDE
			- ![[Pasted image 20220131163215.png]]
