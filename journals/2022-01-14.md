# üì∞ Meeting Log
## Lauren amato
- org burnout
	- She's got to play everybody. So much internal responsibilities now on her
		- someone brings in a new system 3x then they leave and nobody care about it. [[naviga]] is the latest
			- naviga hasn't been used by salesteam except for the minimum to get paid
- [[Data Management Platform]] - 3rd one: why 3? nobody owned, nobody took care of it. If it's not owned
- biggest problem:
	- audience declining
		- competition
			- 6abc.com. Their traffic = 2x by comscore. Uniques
			- Do well in coldweather months
	- don't know enough about who our readers are.
		- limited to GA which is too amorphous
		- don't know where parents go on our site. we don't know if we reach them and if we do how old their kids are.
		- Building first party data strategy then building out to compensate
	- missing survey data
		- we have a survey person on sales side; [[Jody Vaughn]] . Putting together a panel with RAM just for newsletters
			- "Let me make a sales sheet so I can say what our audience is from this" -[[Lauren Amato]]
		- [[Newsletters]] is a good example with newsletter squad.
			- good for big groups, but not the smaller subsets of those function
	- restructuring
		- all programmatic infra
		- adtech partners
		- ad ops
		- working x-department on ad opportunities
		- Digital Ad Strategy + Sales Enablement / Support + Programmatic
			- digital ad budget = 6.6m, programmatic = 2.7 of that
			- print & classified = 18m
		- brand = a challenge. Hear name "Philadelphia Inquirer" and don't think website, think newspaper. Digital = 10x print reach
