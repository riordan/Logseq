There‚Äôs a [[Stack Overflow]] for teams for the Inquirer tech teams!!!

[[Metrics That Matter]]
## Meeting Notes
### [[Matt Boggie]] 1:1 IRL
- [[Analytics Team]] has a lot of half-finished projects
	- [[Mark Loomis]] had room to run, but didn't take things far along a particular vision
		- wanted him to run and run with [[Metrics That Matter]]
- Way to get org to buy into things: don't point out that things are wrong, suggest ways things could be and make them happen. People already know the problems, they haven't done things about them because couldn't mobilize resources.

- 2022 DEI org goals: ^s1l82y
	- Diversity Goals:
		- Open Positions: We will take steps to ensure that all open full-time positions, including leadership positions, have applicant pools with sufficiently diverse candidates to allow the company to achieve a goal of filling such positions with at least:
			- In the newsroom, 60% of individuals from BIPOC communities and 50% identifying as female or non-binary, an
			- For the total organization, 45% of individuals from BIPOC communities, and 50% identifying as female or non-binary.
	- Newsroom Representation Goals:
		- By the end of the year at least 35% of newsroom management will be composed of BIPOC individuals and 40% will identify as female or non-binary.
		- By the end of the year at least 35% of newsroom staff will be composed of BIPOC individuals and 45% will identify as female or non-binary.
	- Adding LGBTQ+ Identity:
		- HR Systems tracking gender identity and sexual orientation
			- First looking at that for candidates for all job applicants starting in 2022-01
			- Waiting on Dayforce for applying to current employees
	- inq4all 2022
		- Works groups on voice, process, culture, coverage
- ### [[Darya Ushakova]]'s Team Strategy and engagement
- Group owns the funnel
	- rachel owns biggest part: traffic
		- main value = more audience, more in market audience, more diverse audience
		- engaging diverse communities in philly
		- Huge task: engagement -> leadgen -> first party registration
			- going largely anonymnous to known users
			- haven't experimented around this much
		- GOAL: increase amount of people logged in
- michelle's world: Total audience: 8.6M in DMA
	- audience been declining. Decline in in-market is bigger than overall
	- Total email DB: 850k addresses. 2022 goal 1.1m
	- 40% registeeed user increase goal
		- some registered for comments, which we got rid of
		- Former subscribers have lots of accounts:
- Sarah: Converting registered -> subscribers
	- nonsubscriber acquisition
	- paywall
- Churn: 0.8 -> 1%: average for industry. OK for our acquisition
	- print / digital subscriber base
- Mather: Just met with a churn propensity model
	- don't have but need to have:
		- What's our retention curve by slices (income, sub source, tenure, pricepoints, engagements)
		- Dangerous / sticky behaviors
			- Been pushing on this since May
- Been challenbes of other parts of the funnel gotten disproportionate attention
- 40% week/week acquisition
- My role focus:
	- Retention
	- Figuring out our audience
		- we don't know who our core readers are
			- learning more about who our readers are so we can build meaningful segments, understand propensity
		- Demographics:
			- would be great if actionalbe for who we can target and personalize
### [[Todd Gillespe]] - senior PM
- longtime PM
	- fullstack eng -> tech lead -> architect -> Product
	- mostly general purpose web
		- amc, rainbow media, msg,
	- startups, ran a ux consultancy
	- 3 yers ago moved to philly
	- enjoys doing dataviz outside of inquirer
- Focuses:
	- Inquirer 2 years ago
		- Initially focused on delivery work
	- Make the API a comprehensive team with a data product
		- from a mishmash of systems to a more self-similar serverless system
			- Pure graphql
	- IDed the need for, and Project Managed and implemented customer data platform: [[Blueconic]]
		- challenges there: marketing team turnover, so CDP sat fallow until about 3 months ago
	- Feed Logic:
		- Likely to continue Feedlogic for next year in his OKRs
		- Been slow
			- eng team busy replatforming entire application
			- LOT OF REGRESSION:
				- tried to build a lot before ready to put effort into it that'd need.
				- started for real in late Q1 this year, but haven't used in practice despite a ton of software delivered
		- Focus has been growing on the non-analytics side of things:
			- More about the content than the aftereffects or measuring success
				- done some experiments on NLP (google NLU API) on descriptive content tags. Human-in-the-loop NLP?
					- Google might not be the most robust way to do this
			- possible interest in AI for content
- PM for data platform
	- been doing a lot of data focused work
		- e.g. Index project; folks weren't asking for it but percieved a need for newsroom to set apples to apples for setting goals that were consolidated
			- Weighted average of a bunch of criteria that builds into 5 different indicies that are above or below 1, where benchmark set from a specific quarter of 2019
			- "I want to hit this unit"
			- 5 things correspond to funnel:
				- discovery
				- engagement
				- subscription
				- retention
				- productivity (publish rate)
- [[Metrics That Matter]]
	- lots of dashboards on Data Studio, but built ad-hoc
		- mostly a catalogue of them documented on confluence
	- ID the metrics that actually matter that we're measuring for our org at a departmental level that will ladder up to org goals at the top
	- [Status Updates](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PD/pages/1697874021/Status+updates+feed+logic+advisory+group)

		- ![[Screen Shot 2021-12-15 at 3.21.16 PM.png]]
	- Audience:
		- definition of penetration is low, especially compared to benchmarks.

### [[Becky Bowers]]

MTM

Not approachable as a project at all.

PM for the data platforms

Technical underpinnings & customer facing pieces. Dave can/probably should just PM this for now. Was going to be the toolkit he brought to this, anyway.

‚ÄúCan I get away with re-scoping it?‚Äù Just two or three meaningful things ‚Ä¶

This is an integration test. Hand off in two years to what will be a sr. PM. Thinking about data exposure internally.

Talking w/marketing folks: I can‚Äôt help you. Need to accelerate org to catch up to them. Let them run w/comfy vendor for now. Be our north star customer.

They need quick & dirty to get job done but want high dimensionality. It needs internal expertise to be good.

Align w/targeting system. Customer database. Segmentation data. Advertising partners.

Commenting: Slow, low-hanging fruit: Metrics from every system that we have and the content easily accessible from the data warehouse. PMs should be able to get Viafoura data from big query.

NEED NEW/BETTER DECK TEMPLATES

FOR PROJECT INKY?
- Incidental to Inky in the way we release it. Prototype that feels right/is usable. Modular. Noodling on Inky and did this thing.
- Get Westin to do it‚Äîassets to make good slides, etc.
- Slide SDK to make better slides‚Äîlayout, colors, asset pools
- Then, formal templates that get backed in.
- Then the slide buffet‚Äîwhere we can standardize around various comms. (Which charts. Pyramid assets.)
