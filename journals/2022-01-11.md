### [[Becky Bowers]] 1-1
- Inq studio has eyes bigger than their stomach. Need to create a sense of ownership for elizabeth.
- "We need anything that can drive insights at the desk-level because that was the only way to drive innovation in the newsroom where it happens. Innovation actionably happens at the desk level."

## [[Brian Waligorski]] 1:1
-   Prioritization framework for data porting
	-   NOT
		- Scream tests (alone)
	- AFFIRMATIVELY
		1. Major blockers (projects)
		2. Organizational Alignment (lots of uses, varied methods) / convergent tools and practices
		3. Maintenance/support overhead (capacity killers - operational)
		4. Time sinks (Low variance productivity)
		5. Opportunity to eliminate complexity for others
- Questions ^t80vuw
	- How do we get the users of a tool to accept one place where there have been many
	- How do we get people to consolidate their requests against a solid base tool (e.g. all questions of this type get answered in Google Analytics, all questions like that get answered on a set of DataStudio dashboards (or BI dashboards) (vs standalone, but possibly regularized reports).
	- ACTION ITEM: List of tables by dashboard/deliverable reference count
