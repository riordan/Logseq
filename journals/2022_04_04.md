			- Marketing underserved needs:
				- Retention reporting: underserved for years
					- Must do onsite: Customer onboarding.
						- we do have a welcome journey: 4 emails sent out to new subscribers
						- No touchpoints onsite, nothing driving stickiness
					- [[Onboarding Journey]]: 3 phases
						- Welcome: first 30 days post subscription
							- Digital, print, former digital/print subs get 8-10 emails over the course of a month showing benefits of subscriptions
							- Onsite touchpoints: Will be blueconic toasters for now; showing value
						- Nurture:
							- Reconnect using same vehicles (email, onsite, telesales, directmail, paid social) based on behavior
							- Personalizing (e.g. reading sports every day; not signed up for daily sports newsletters)
							- sending out comms that get them to read content they like onsite
							- "Subscriber Connections"
						- Reengagement:
