- Meetings:

		  collapsed:: true
			- Marketing underserved needs:
				- Retention reporting: underserved for years
					- Must do onsite: Customer onboarding.
						- we do have a welcome journey: 4 emails sent out to new subscribers
						- No touchpoints onsite, nothing driving stickiness
					- [[Onboarding Journey]]:
						- 3 phases to user journey
							- Welcome: first 30 days post subscription
								- Digital, print, former digital/print subs get 8-10 emails over the course of a month showing benefits of subscriptions
								- Onsite touchpoints: Will be blueconic toasters for now; showing value
							- Nurture:
								- Reconnect using same vehicles (email, onsite, telesales, directmail, paid social) based on behavior
								- Personalizing (e.g. reading sports every day; not signed up for daily sports newsletters)
								- sending out comms that get them to read content they like onsite
								- "Subscriber Connections"
							- Reengagement: Dropout
								- Starting with Paid social: FB and Instagram
								- Working on email from Blueconic:
									- once there's a connection, will email based on engagement behavior
						- Going to need to figure out: 1. how to build, but 2: how to monitor
							- How to monitor [[Onboarding Journey]] will need to be set up with [[Analytics Team]]

			- comms
			- [[Datadog]] - supposed to have a bunch of tests for us
	- [[Eva]] and [[Aquil]] [[Data Engineering]] onboarding #meeting
		- "There's a lot of names; will I have to remember them all?"
	- [[Alexandra]] #meeting/1:1
		- Previously been on very reactive teams, taking work as it comes
		- First real set of goals
			- Previously did Q4 OKRs with [[inquirer/analytics]]
			- These goals are much more fitting
		- work at nonprofit: who was covered by what grant
			- Hadn't had coverage before of this data
		- Naviga work's been real reactive:
			- "Do you know why this is happening?" Research -> case
			- "Why's it there"
			- LATER Need to find an owner for [[Naviga]]. Not acceptable for main sales report not aligning to financial measures.
