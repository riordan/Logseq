## [[incident.io]] and [[Incident Management]]
- Yann Safati
- incident.io goal = follow right goal when it comes to following incidents;
	- no admin for engineers: just focus on the right thing
	- Lots of alerting tools, but little ways to bringt people together
- actions & tasks derived from incident types
## Audience Goal Definition:
Agenda:
There has been some ambiguity around the definitions of 2 of the company goal metrics (digital interactions per month; and subs with at least 1 interaction per month) and the purpose of this meeting is to get alignment on:
### (a) how the goal was previously defined as presented 
Interactions / (All subscribers w/ digital access)
### (b) how should the goal be defined (if previous defintion was incorrect)
### (c) talk through work arounds if data gaps exist
## [[Jen McGroaty]]
- Circulation owns [[DSI]]:
	- Customer side
		- Lori Dowling
		- Jim Gorman
	- Maintainance & Reporting: = [[Jim Anton]]
	- DSI is too big to fail - too tied into operations
		- every few months talk about getting rid of dsi, then a few years ago "We're coming off a print plan" and deciding if building print billing practices into SF
- SF docs:
	- https://inquirer.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SFUAT/pages
- DSI -> Salesforce timing
	- a month after; about a year ago
	- Didn't import historical data prior to 3 years back
