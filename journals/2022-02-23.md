# 0. Dayplan
## 🌤 1. **FILL OUT** Morning Journal
### What are you grateful for?
Space to fafff around; but more so the sense of humility to recognize when I’ve been fucking up and can do better; so much better.

The humility to recover. To accelerate. To go beyond. To do more than enough for others, not just the bare minimum.
### What do you want today's highlight to be?
1. To create a product that enables others to do something with greater focus and clarity. To make paths easier. In this case, it means a work plan for the kickoff: how do we start to have the conversations that are needed.
2. That and to have digested my notes into an organized place so that they’re ready for tomorrow and my commitments can be followed up upon.
### What are today's mantras
- plan Ahead; don’t just look ahead. Anticipate and account. That way you’ll be ready.
### What's on your mind?
