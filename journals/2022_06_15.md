		- Notes:
			- ![Notes](../assets/2022-06-15 12-30 The Pie Shop matt and dave.pdf)
				- Product health framework to inform everything
				- No "Canary Metrics" for the site
					- [[Canary Metrics]] could be something like
						- Time on page / site
						- Scroll depth
						- Pages post-interaction / exposure
						- Survey: Happiness
					- How are we doing in terms of the health of our product.
						- [[UX Metrics]] / [[HEART Framework]]
					- Closest thing we have to that is [[Newsletters]]  Working Group, where there's an open rate that informs things.
						- [[Julia Haslinger]] Sez:
							- > fwiw, the newsroom metrics are also pretty revenue-focused (pageviews and conversions) + production (which is intended to boost pageviews and conversions totals)
							  12:24
							  non-revenue related behavior metrics:
							  how they got to the story (search/social etc.)
							  how long they were on the page / here for the visit
							  how far they scrolled through the article body
							  12:25
							  non-revenue related demo metrics:
							  in-dma / not
							  age (for a small subset of users)
							  gender (m/f only)
				- How do we actually make this happen?
					- Too cheap to meter health metrics
					- PM + Designer training on metric
