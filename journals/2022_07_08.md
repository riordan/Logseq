## Actual Work & Scratch
	- ## [[Marketing]] Needs with [[Dan]]
		- Acquisition:
			- [[Sarah Jarvis]] has a lot of requests re meter optimization on web and app
				- Wants to make sure that's still relevant considering our diminishing returns
				- Also - Acquisition
					- Registration = subset, especially softer paywall
					- Differentiate that when communicating numbers
					- Need to communicate different types of meter stops
		- BIG ONE: [[Retention Reporting]] and [[Segmentation]] HITS ALL DEPARTMENTS
		  collapsed:: true
			- James on [[rachelc]]'s team: How much do we throw at Bracket Jawn customers next year for acquisition.
				- Retention = acquisition budget forecast. How much do we want to spend per customer acusition for channels given how long they stick around? How much effort do we want to put to things given how long they stick around?
				- Retention = segmentation opportunity sizing
			- [[Darya]] irritated at [[Mather]] only offered retention over last 5 years, but not by segments and not live
			- Daniel's retention reporting approach: good foundation to what we want to do
				- expand the viz and end user interaction
					- survival curves with drop-downs
						- survival curve comparison
				- Potential product roadmap
					- Segmentation -> audience insights
				- Hex app could work
				-

		- NEW - Paid Media Dashboard. HITS ALL DEPARTMENTS
		  collapsed:: true
			- Every sub-department of marketing has marketing/seo/paid media going on, tracked in individual systems
				- FB, Instagram, Google, Twitter
				- Paid Search & Paid Social
				- This is coming into Supermetrics already **Which I didn't know we were doing** into Data Studio
			- They track CPA's very closely, but not aggregated today
		- Partnering w/ finance to improve data process
		- TLDR: Faster we can connect this to dollars.
			- Product too: Cancellation experience to higher dollar figures
		- Dashboard use:
			- Many used multiple times a day, but only use specific parts.
			- opportunity to bring together
		- Unknowns:
			- Salesforce & email: Only at aggregate level
				- Don't have modeled user-engagement per-email
