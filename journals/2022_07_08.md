## Actual Work & Scratch
	- ## [[Marketing]] Needs with [[Dan]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Acquisition:
			- [[Sarah Jarvis]] has a lot of requests re meter optimization on web and app
				- Wants to make sure that's still relevant considering our diminishing returns
				- Also - Acquisition
					- Registration = subset, especially softer paywall
					- Differentiate that when communicating numbers
					- Need to communicate different types of meter stops
		- BIG ONE: [[Retention Reporting]] and [[Segmentation]] HITS ALL DEPARTMENTS
		  collapsed:: true
			- James on [[rachelc]]'s team: How much do we throw at Bracket Jawn customers next year for acquisition.
				- Retention = acquisition budget forecast. How much do we want to spend per customer acusition for channels given how long they stick around? How much effort do we want to put to things given how long they stick around?
				- Retention = segmentation opportunity sizing
			- [[Darya]] irritated at [[Mather]] only offered retention over last 5 years, but not by segments and not live
			- Daniel's retention reporting approach: good foundation to what we want to do
				- expand the viz and end user interaction
					- survival curves with drop-downs
						- survival curve comparison
				- Potential product roadmap
					- Segmentation -> audience insights
				- Hex app could work
				-
			-
			-
		- NEW - Paid Media Dashboard. HITS ALL DEPARTMENTS
		  collapsed:: true
			- Every sub-department of marketing has marketing/seo/paid media going on, tracked in individual systems
				- FB, Instagram, Google, Twitter
				- Paid Search & Paid Social
				- This is coming into Supermetrics already **Which I didn't know we were doing** into Data Studio
			- They track CPA's very closely, but not aggregated today
		- Partnering w/ finance to improve data process
		- TLDR: Faster we can connect this to dollars.
			- Product too: Cancellation experience to higher dollar figures
		- Dashboard use:
			- Many used multiple times a day, but only use specific parts.
			- opportunity to bring together
		- Unknowns:
			- Salesforce & email: Only at aggregate level
				- Don't have modeled user-engagement per-email
				- don't know of SFMC has data t that granularity
			- Retention - just a lot
				- Gets longer the closer we get to the end-goal of satisfying their segmentation and scalability
			- Weird not knowing where anything is, but getting better at capturing and opportunities
				- Hard to find: general sense
			- Surprises:
				- no retention reporting
			- Hidden opportunities:
				- People looking at very specific things on one dashboard, but there's an opportunity to pair that down and give better quality
					- redoing meter dash
					- building audience insights off of retention segmentation
				- Paid media dashboard could be an easy win
			- Interests
				- Retention = top priority
				- Acquisition priority on experiments too
				-
	- Next steps. onUSD with [[Aaron Moore]]
		- Go over next steps for Phase 2 with Dan and come up with timelines.
	- ## [[Matt]] prep
		- ### Foundation
			-
		- ### Roadmap
			-
		- ### Visibility
			- Current blockers to visibility:
				- Had been missing key personnel for Marketing Analytics until mid-May and product analytics had been pulled into Subscriber data project. Analysts are how the data and insights team delivers most data value, so until now we've been
				- Proposals for things
