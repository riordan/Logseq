	- What did you accomplish today?
	- What did you learn today?
		- So much.
		- You are not showing progress externally. This is scaring key stakeholders. This should not be hard to fix.
		- The ads folks are down
		- Growthbook is insanely easy and is ready for adoption
			- To adopt growthbook, we backfill the experiments table, validate metrics against prior experiment analyses
			- Build out new key metrics
		- Product Dashboard [DIRECTIONAL KPIs]
			- 1DAU/28DAU (MAU)
			- % Active subscribers
			- Retention = see max windows
		- Need to show folks what working with good, clean datasets looks like.
			- Document the datasets you've been working with tonight are like around hits + experiments + subscribers + users
				- hits table needs:
					- experiments (array_agg)
					- browser
					- scroll depth events
					- clearer way to denote what page or URL a hit is on (e.g. scroll depth capture on articles and sections)
					-
				- sub_engage_daily = bad agg table; should be relying on agg_sub_engagement +  dim_subs_YYYYmmdd
				- agg_user_engagement should be:
					- day_date
					- sf_user_id (ALL USERS)
					- is_subscribed (for this model to work, is_subscribed = still gets a paper sent to their house that day or can still access the site that day)
					- subscriber.
						- sf_subscription_id[nullable]
						- sf_account_id
						- is_print_subscriber
						- is_digital_subscriber
						- is_ingrace
						- is_canceled (in period where has terminated account, but still has remaining period of access)
						- is_delivery_onhold (has print delivery on hold)
						- is_flipped (or whatever we call the periods where we adjust rates)
						- is_ratebumped
						- subscription_status_change - If a change in the subscription occured on that day; it goes here. Subscribe, churn, upgrade, downgrade
					- is_newsletter_subscriber
					- newsletter_subscriptions (number of newsletter subscriptions)
					- newsletters. (START AS ITS OWN table, organized as array_AGG, THEN JOIN IN)
						- NLNAME.is_subscribed [TRUE/FALSE/NULL if newsletter not yet available]
						- NLNAME.opened [TRUE / FALSE / NULL IF NOT SUBSCRIBED]
						- NLNAME.clickedthrough
					- engagement
					  collapsed:: true
						- is_1dau
						- is_7dau
						- is_14dau
						- is_28dau (PREFERRED OVER 30DAU)
						- is_30dau
						- (NEED A DECISION ABOUT WHAT COUNTS AS ENGAGED)
						- web_sessions
						- app_sessions
						- e_edition_sessions
						- articles_read
						- articles_completed
							- articles_50p
							- articles.(length buckets)
						- engaged_time
						- commented
						- n_comments
						- (can do things like this for section loyalty as well)
						-
					- {Equivalent high level for marketing emails; specifics as separate daily table to be joined}
					- {marketing direct mail}
			- This will allow us to build a backlog for data improvements, not jsut for eng features
