	- [[Last Mile Project]]  & CDDI
		- Chris Mayer: Consultant
			- Working on project for last few months
			- Looking at carrier-level info and what would be driving performance
			- Looking into subscriber -> carrier performance
				- Jeff pulled 91k subs to build out a tool to get visibility of profitability of different delivery areas for delivery changes
			- Using Excel
				- augmenting with trucking, warehouse, subscriber credits, delivery cost
				- Then map to delivery for routes that are filled vs open
			- Now can try to recalculate profitability at risk, and based on retention & impact to rate, what impact to org is
			- Look at fixed costs
		- Excel:
			- 100k rows
			- amalgam of different data sources
		- Steps:
			- 1. How to continue to refresh to support this analysis
			  2. Add in next steps (e.g. single copy)
			  3. Eventually move to a long-term tool
		- Exporting:
			- [[Jim Anton]] doing the exports
			- [[mark ganslaugh]] wrote the query on DSI Oracle
		- Other data sources:
			- Census: Postcode -> sqMi tract
		- Notes:
			- Should put start date on extracts: who as a
			- Subscribers on vacation stops should be treated as active
		- Next steps:
			- [x] Send Chris revised extract data
			- [ ] work with jim anton to automate the process
		- Our plan:
			- Background:
				- Chris is a consultant working with us on the last mile project. He's built a model in Excel that's used to explore different scenarios for how we do home delivery.
				- The data that powers this is (mostly) from DSI.
				- We're going to provide this data via BigQuery & the ODBC connector
				- Jim Anton has a set of queries provided by Mark Ganslaw that build the extract; rather than rewrite these queries to run on BQ, we're just going to have Informatica put it up there; presumibly on a monthly basis (I don't think many of us want to rewrite PL/SQL)
				- We'll configure the excel package to connect to BQ with a highly restricted service account (only one table access)
				- If this project gets additional resources, we'll consider what it will take to move the underlying data extract to BQ / DBT.
