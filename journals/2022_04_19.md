		  “We have more P1 bugs in production than ever”

		  Product quality

		  Passive monitoring metrics layer (Engineering)
		  Proposed set of rules for alerting (non-operations-changing, but maybe operational)

		  When Mark Loomis is the Anamoly Bot: it gets triaged and addressed immediately.
		  Q3: Substantial observability and get out of mark’s DMS, get mark out of being the Anamoly Bot.
		- Action items

		- In-market down; what we can control
		- Paywall vs Subscriber-only stories
			- [[dan hirshhorn]]: We are choosing to add more paying subscribers over the decision to have a lager top-line audience on the story. Come to have a very good appreciation of it
				- [[Sam Ruland]]:
				  > It’s about teaching people that this journalism takes time and money to produce and we need support to do that. The more things that get subscriber (and the longer we do this) the more we’ll show our readership that quality like that will be behind a paywall for a reason.
