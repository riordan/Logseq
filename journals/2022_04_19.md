				- Matt,
				  
				  Looking back on my first four months here, it feels clear to me that I'm not operating at my personal level of expectations. I feel like I'm getting stuck on simple things and am at a disadvantage in knowing how to best move my teams along, coordinate large-scale projects and keep momentum up, while also having the time to look ahead in ways that shows others the path (and not just me).
				  
				  I worry that my effectiveness might be wearing off, that my initial shinyness might not be living up to expectations, and that will make things even harder to get done, as the things we do inherently become more challenging on their own.
				  
				  I often feel like I'm disconnected from the work of my team, and likewise my own drive and focus makes it hard to keep digging in without disrupting or micro-managing the work. Even if I can tell things aren't going great, I don't know how to best observe, let alone intervene.
				  
				  I'd love a hand in some of this. Not to do less, but rather some guidance in how to be more effective in this kind of role. In so many ways, our week onsite at the office felt like the first week I was able get the kind of collaboration, input into my work, and visibility into others that has historically made me effective.
			- [[Laura Gordon]] Feedback: on ((625ee914-0fb7-4e69-9c15-0cadfb9b3d41))
				- Think of key notes of what you're trying to get across:
					- What is the goal?: More time working together; mentorship
					- What will this give him? Increased efficiency from me and my teams.
						- I want to get better.
				- Better ask: IRL joint meetup
				- Worries
					- harder to start
					- worried about judgement as personal failings
			- Draft 2:
				- Hey Matt,
				  
				  I've been realizing that it's been a while since I had a good "Joint Work Session" with folks at The Inquirer.
