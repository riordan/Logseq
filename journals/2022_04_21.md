		- Peeople don't like to work in the open early; they feel exposed
		- reporters can't start the race late
		- Tooling: websked insufficient for daily + long term planning
		  collapsed:: true
			- no tools for photo, graphics, interactives
			- no calendar view: works for the day, but omitting key inputs (photo, graphics, interactive)
			- Workflow for input not great
			- Accuracy of date projections
			- Data problem: No fields
		- Patrick Wants to start do some more optional categorical tags
			- set goals around things like storyform: An editor can understand that and meet that; not traffic targets
			- Areas:
				- Storyform:
					- visual, explainer, aggregation, enterprise, breaking
				- Level of effort:
					- how hard is it
			- compare things like enterprise vs low lift
		- [[Inquirer Content Strategy]]
			- Be more judicious about enterprise
				- don't give people the ability to visualize how their people are being committed
				- Works best if
	- We have visualization problems all over the place
	- Metrics for News initiative
		- american press insitute
		- heavy categorization effort; lot of topical categorization
	- "The newsroom is opaque" is the reality within the newsroom

- what are we able to do when news happens when arc goes down
	- Incident where arc went out for enough time that news broke
	- Newsroom needed to know how to tell people that news happened without arc
	- push alert, email alert, without a link to site, tweet without a link to site

Once we move past the evaluation stage for whatever data catalog partner we pursue this will move to using shared SSO (e.g. Google or Okta), but for now
