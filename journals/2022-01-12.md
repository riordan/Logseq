- New PM for reader experience
	- questions: priorities for year
		- where's the biggest impact
	- Lots of assumptions, not many are validated
		- Going to be doing a lot of work on the app:
			- are our app users more loyal, where do we see them in our funnel
> Brian says app team is pretty much at the end of its backlog and is ready to start adding. For 2022: Can we roadmap the app in a way that’s developing it to be a place for our most loyal users? (My hypothesis/general industry) 

1.  We need data - 

1.  ARE app users the most loyal? (I am assuming yes but would want to find out 100%): How many active app users, how many downloads, how many un-installs, how often is the audience coming, breakdown of paying/unpaid or subscriber/registered/anonymous. Pageviews/session etc — maybe this is information that Marketing has? Brian did not know
2.  Can we survey the people using the app? Is there are prominent place to ask users questions like: What are you coming to the app for (section, person etc), what would make you stay

1.  Maybe that’s what needs to be built first

1.  From there, can figure out three things:

1.  How’s the app doing? Is it serving its purpose for its existing users?
2.  How app work should be prioritized alongside all the other work/if it is a big deal to the company right now (again my hypothesis is that app downloads are key to ideal customer retention)
3.  Best path to improve the app - features-wise, etc

1.  Then priorities emerge and can be sized and tackled and measured

If we can start to develop a product funnel in this way, then outside the app things can fall into place - CTAs to promote to the app in specific places on web/mobile web, etc.   
Create the journey (IDK what that is yet): One-time website user > newsletter subscriber > app downloader > many-many time content reader > loyal/could subscribe/champion others to download app or subscribeOnce that’s established as the drumbeat, provides a baseline to experiment:  
-Sports!!   
-Micropayments/day pass  
-Elevating personalities  
-Food/dining, openings & closings, things to do, And there can be cross-departmental alignment:  
-If app is ID’d as crucial, maybe there’s a deal to download from marketing: 3 free articles a month on app only, gift an article on app if you’re a subscriber etc  
-Always Philly - feels like it aligns already - Philly in the palm of your hand  
-Geolocation/personalization features to align to that ^^   
-PUSH ALERTS FROM APP $$$ (vendor: Airship)X-Factors that make app an even stronger sell:  
We need this customer data because of cookie-gate/ad stuff
