### Conversation / Meeting Notes
#### [[Matt Boggie]]
- Effeciences for good
	- efficiencies been thought of from company bottom line. Not bottom up as capability enablement.
- Standing apart from their jobs and look at themselves in the third person. How would I advise someone else with this.
- Increasingly 2 companies within the inquirer.
	- The "one" of skinnerboxes is dwindling. The one of growing opportunities is increasing.

#### okr planning
- push out
	- how does everyones job support the mission


#### Marketing bigquery access
Background:
	- Need to pull data out for Devin to do his work.
	- S3 -> GBQ
		- marketing cloud = for email and SMS, but not capable of covering telemarketing and directmail blasts
	- Need:
		- Blueconic data, joined to subscription data to do subscription direct mail
		- Devin will go into BQ
	- Reason:
		- never put in place all the tools for D2G Discovery
	- Budget for direct mail for retention and reengagement on site; which is why need blueconic information to interface with this
		- Toan's team has been helping with existing directmail (e.g. credit card declined) and PISA telemarketing
	- Specific data:
		- Blueconic overlaying on paid subscribers with what content they viewed online
		- Examples:
			- did they use our site at all?
			- If so, what content they used
		- Need a place for the data to sit once created for these directmail campaigns
