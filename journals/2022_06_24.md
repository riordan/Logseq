## Actual Work & Scratch
	- ((62b5c25b-1b39-4aca-b623-9e8d48e88aa1))
	  collapsed:: true
		- Workshop: Good idea - Had a hard time getting product team to articulate what a good visit looks like for a user
		  collapsed:: true
			- 40% of nonsub visits end in a stop: Is that success?
			- Adding qualitative - talked about for years
				- ask someone about ads, is it a net positive?
			- Challenges to measure some tactically (where?)
				- Sample size problems
					- ads; have a ton of volume on homepage
					- Moreso in churn;
						- longer time to have subs turnover
				- Implementation issues:
					- can do splits in a variety of ways in the site, measure in GA, but data doesn't come over to ad revenue system
						- e.g. pull in a split group to ad revenue dataset would help us
						-
				- Causality problems
		- [[GA4]] for metrics; don't trust yet
			- Belief from folks in the wild
				- Unsure of extent of how our numbers will change
				- Unsure of different methods to access / pull data from it
				- Incomplete feature-wise
				- Won't work on [[AMP]]
				- didn't look at product stack holistically
					- [[gtm]] took a step back with this ga4 product
		- [[Experimentation Platform]] Alternatives
			- looking at others with previous tech leads
				- feature flags
				- data capture
				- more engineering tied
			- Played with Optimizely and used VWO for a while
			-

	  collapsed:: true
		- Kid / Moving - should write down my thoughts ahead of time
			- For us to talk about a second kid; I want us to make progress on these things ahead of time
				- have a conversation without being afraid Kay will get mad
				- Able to take time equally
				- Respectful of one another
					- Respect matters a LOT to Kay, yet the bulk of our interactions indicate disrespect to me.
				- Eroding self-respect and self confidence
			- Having a second kid is >2n work and time. Additional stress bad for kids, separation even worse.
				- Until baseline stress is under control and our relationship to one another feels mutually safe again, I'm opposed to having another kid. I want to protect our family's existence, Zev's relationship to us, and our relation to one another.
				- I don't want you or Zev to feel alone; a sibling for Zev won't be enough to fix that on its own.
		- I've been successful in roles where I've had a thought partner to push me to completion in tasks; someone to workshop things with along the way, all the way back to Dad guiding me through homework so I'd get it done, Vershbow peering with me, Edward at Spotify, etc.
		- Skill defecit; takes lots of time to prep to and think things through
			- take the prep time to organize your thoughts
			- write everything; pick out the heart
			-
			- Start arguing with myself before I even get the thought out
				- even in argument; avoid the conflict with myself
