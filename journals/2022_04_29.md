	- What's one thing I learned yesterday?

	- What's one thing I'm grateful for today?
		- To have the space and time to work on the move. Movement is life. Change is important.
	- What's one thing I want to accomplish today?
		- Have an understanding of [[GA4 Migration]] with [[Hawk Shannon]].
	- What's one challenge I may experience today?
