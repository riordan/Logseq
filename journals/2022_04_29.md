  collapsed:: true
	- What's one thing I learned yesterday?
		- I might not come off as angry to others when I'm frustrated. It might only be something that Kay picks up on. Perhaps I'm not as angry as I once thought?
	- What's one thing I'm grateful for today?
		- To have the space and time to work on the move. Movement is life. Change is important.
	- What's one thing I want to accomplish today?
		- Have an understanding of [[GA4 Migration]] with [[Hawk Shannon]].
	- What's one challenge I may experience today?
		- Covid. The office might not be as revitalizing for me as I thought.
	- Any other thoughts?
		- I hope I don't screw up my marriage by going to philly today.
