# Meetings

## [[Mark Loomis]] 10-11
Mark's Notes:

- Org using confluence heavily
- Been a lot of change for the team and the company. Through that change things have gotten messy.
	- Important to go back
- **History**
	- 2 analysts, someone in testing and optimization
	- Mark and daniel running team and daniel handling  DS
		- serving consumer marketing, newsroom, and product
		- getting bogged down in implementations - eg digital analytics
			- spending so much time on integrations and reports on "what happened" not, "why"
			- Doing real work required time they didn't have
		- Decided to take advantage of other groups doing A@S
			- Analytics Editor - now Julia - now part of the team (formerly Karla Ovalle)
				- Karla behaved as a part of the team, but in her exit interview said she should be part of the team and so did her predecessor.
			- Ad sales Alex's boss left. Everybody's pretty new on the team.
			- Nat - analyst left (now Hawk). Was a semi senior role
			-  Elizabeth transfered out to marketing. 
				-  Lost marketing role when Marketing department 3x-ed and became very data focused.
					-  THINK needs a data marketing lead. Kate's got good marketing and data experience. She **could** be either Marketing Analyst or Product Analyst. 
					-  Generally need to improve relationship with product.
			-  Replacing Daniel role - hadn't been planning on replacing Data Science capacity until mid-year.
				-  Kate's been here a while and is great and can do anything.
				-  Julia's in the where do we get the data place
				-  Alex - junior in technical skills
				-  hawk - very defined role, but can grow
		-  Data  engineering group:
			-  bran's great, but backlog of tech debt piling up and have to address it
			-  Lots of dat aprojects have been building out foundations. "Can't keep kicking can down the road" and ignoring foundational work
			-  Getting this group up and running 
			-  Don't need institutional memory <- me


External:
- data PM role
	- Brian has experience in that.
	- We have a posting
- Testing and optimization specialist - AB testing program -= previously liz
	- was good at project management skills, but not necessarially analysis. team pitched in for that
	- Now there's a hole. She took marketing experimentation into her new role in Dariia's team.

Report development group:
- "enterprise application support" (Albert & Jim) folks who know SQL
	- SME's with the systems who know stakeholders. Production support folks
	- Alex in marketing wants to get better at SQL
	- DE's could oversee this


Team:
- connection to newsroom and product is vital
	- morning newsroom meeting is open to everyone over zoom
		- morning meeting is mostly digital; afternoon is mostly A1
		- standing zoom link
- Skillset development is critical
	- Losing expertise with daniel, Mark's expertise to develop team isn't there at a technical level; daniel doens't want to manage peopel but is a good mentor
	- Team's losing data science development
	- Julia's getting DS masters now

- Have struggled excecuting academic partnerships; time cycles don't always line up


- Daniel is part time now:
	- Had planned on not extending past EoY
	- Would like to get a contract in place with no commitment
		- Is responsible for data pipelining and data engineering
		- Possible for support if pipeline systems blow up.
	- Wasn't happy for a while.
	- 50/50 to get a contract through
		- if we extend to actual work is a possibility, but if there's a small retainer for support



Data strategy:
- based off of Deloitte maturity model; framed around newsrooms
- Would be good to 
	- 


Structured Interview Questions:

### 1. What are the biggest challenges the inquirer is facing, or will face in the near future?

### 2. Why is the inquirer facing (or going to face) these challenges?

### 3. What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth?

### 4. What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these offerings

### 5. If you were me, what would you focus attention on?

### Functional:
- weekly's - 1 hr


### Personal Questions:
- what brought you back?

## Kate 1pm

Background:
- How'd you get here?
	- Liberal arts background out of school
	- editorial or publishing, but "be real" about it
	- Wound up doing social media market research in pharma
	- joined inquirer data analyst
	- Communication pieces have been super valuable - harder skill to pick up on the fly
- How'd you move across the organization
	- MOre focused on implementation - digital analytics side. Very product focused with some work with editorial team.
	- Not exposed to too many groups
		- marketing's tooling was baked, product had a more experimental / new approach
	- last six months - very intentional approach to analytical work. Shift away from implemnetation work and insights.
		- more focus in strategy sense. Now more of a jump into marketing.. 
		- Been able to offer higher value work to product team. But interesting working across the departments
		- Stakeholders in MRKT and PROD are candid about tradeoffs and what they want.
		- Desire for data and what they want is different for all those groups.
			- Eidtorial from a leadership perspective wants more and super involved and empirically focused. But disconnect to newsroom and journalists.
				- journalists don't think they have access to what they feel like is the right information and how to use it and how its used
			- Marketing very clear for data they want to see and how its important and broader goals to company.
				- always work to do for them. Priority and impact is important for them
			- Product has desire for data and engagement for data and goalsetting mindsets, but not as data literate.
				- Will have to come more from our team
				- that group has tried to do analysis so many times (eg offsite)
					- input thinking vs output thinking
				- eg previous app PM had all their roadmaps ready to go, but other groups didn't tend to have long-views of projects, which makes it inherently difficult to think about translational long term way of thinking that allows hypothesis driven work
				- Design side has an apprehension of failing
				- PMs don't think they have time to circle back to things or think about evaluations
			- Daniel had started doing more integrative mixed methods work.
				- Product designers had been doign a bunch of reader experience interviews and surveys. Is qualitative data more helpful?
				- product designers have an appetite to partner with us
					- there's been very little just with produt design team - usually Product + PD


**Structured Interview Questions:**

### 1. What are the biggest challenges the inquirer is facing, or will face in the near future?

- the team:
	- historically bandwidth and managing needs of all the different teams
	- Now: onboarding and ensuring people are in the right space and has right resources
	- holitically: balancing differnt data needs of different groups and handling different nuances
		- eg marketing vs product
		- somewhat unclear as to how it focuses for things that don't fit neatly into staffed buckets (eg editorial, marketing)
			- eg integrated research framework
			- lots of reader and subscritpion work that sits under product, but it's got major marketing implications, so where should the analyst for that sit?
- The inquirer
	- challenge of clear goalsetting at the org level
		- makes our work harder
		- Missing how broader org goals trickle down into different departments and different projects
			- still not super clear - constant questions about "is this the new thing we're doing. Today's conversions, tomorrow's habit; whats the priority"
- Being more connected to the community and the community's needs.
	- difficult to measure quantitatively
	- in terms of product development - being more connected to community in meaningful ways in produc t and journalism side
	- challenge of maintaining status of "the paper of record". This is the newspaper, this is stuffy because its important and its important because we report it

### 2. Why is the inquirer facing (or going to face) these challenges?

### 3. What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth?

- Team level:
	- lots of foundation setting and initial work on interesting projects that haven't come to fruition (priorities, stakeholder interest waning)
		- eg sub retention work: we should have a definitive work for "do we retain our subscribers well"
			- norotiously hard to cancel
		- "DONT EVEN KNOW WHERE TO FIND RETENTION NUMBERS"
		- Have a weekly KPR report, but wasn't super utilized and were questions of is this even important
		- Metrics that matter = org goals
		- sub retention have done the foundational work for
	- Working on rebuilding subscription and paywall reporting on that
		- marketing team has traditionally used that data, but is very marketing focused. MTM should go from being marketing-focused data source to something that's more distillable
		- Conversion + subscription reporting available in the way that each team needs it.
			- marketing needs it from channels, product wants this page vs that, editorial wants what article
	- Data as the product
		- datapoints that are used broadly - in a ga report, in BQ
			- its particular, what the actual datapoint is
			- GA used a lot - for lots of reporting its good enough, but for complexity requires clickstream in BQ
				- Daniel created flattened clickstream BQ tables
					- haven't usex original tables since daniel built his flattened tables
					- 
### 4. What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these offerings

### 5. If you were me, what would you focus attention on?
- Idea of everyone having clear, set goals, and having data set up in a way to measure aginst those goals.
	- Been hard for a@S to juggle broad conversations and understand different groups data needs no matter how they can fulfil them (in particular the more complex ones) and do the data work too
	- bhave data meet people where they're at, help other groups build their goals in a meaningful way
	- Moving them 	from being a service desk to a partner. More meaningfully a part of the conversations



## Brian W

- architecture
	- airflow at warner
	- testing dataform as modeling solution, but DBT industry leader
- would hate for data platform to be a buncha jira tickets; folks can write extract tools


Existing team pain points:
- DE problems aren't difficult technical problems; they'r business problems.
	- Send VP in to make different stakeholders call subscribers the same thing, and if not call it something different
	- Culture of documentation is exceptional, but out of jnecessity and have been a self-governing nation for a long time


background:
- grew up in south jersey, bounced around dc, chicago, madison, then came back to philly
- recruiter call to historical newspaper heartstring pull
- 

### 1. What are the biggest challenges the inquirer is facing, or will face in the near future?
- data engineering work has been done in an ad-hoc way. because a@s is junior, and it's decentralized from analytics
	- backend developers did the data pipeline work
		- SFTP to BQ is done by: Lambda function making calls to firebase -> S3 -> Stitch -> BQ
		- We schedule thigns in 12 different places
	- We have a custom stitch tap for all S3 data, including do not call, typesetting, salesforce stuff
		- data acquisition framework needed too

Tech debt piling up:
- Stitch and Informatica
	- Stitch = 2m loc tap
	- Using informatica for pulling SF data to BQ
	- 

## Biweekly [Big] Product Sync
- weekly = internal, biweekly = with stakeholders


## [[becky bowers]]
- ad strategy multi year journey to become product directed
- Keri bettigold - PM for service journalism and sports

### [[Daniel McNichol]] in prep for [[2021-12-08]]
>Mark might have mentioned these already, but some high level pre-reads / post-reads for our convo tomorrow:  
> 
> 1.[Mark & I’s latest Data Strategy docs](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/229131/Inquirer+Data+Strategy) (last updated in Oct) - gives the broadest overview of our assessment of past & current data operations & paths forward etc. A lot here, for better or worse.
> 2. Writeup of responses to an internal [Data Stakeholder Survey](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/868810857/Data+Stakeholder+Survey+Responses+Q1+2021) we conducted in Q1 2021 to get a deeper pulse on stakeholder needs & sentiments. A bit dated at this point but also still largely relevant.
> 
> Our internal notes [here](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/852361243/Data+Stakeholder+Survey+Response+Analysis+INTERNAL)
> 
> Lots of other stuff I can point to, e.g. the [Situational Awareness section](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/1747157152/Analytics+Team+Onboarding+-+Brian#%F0%9F%93%8A-Situational-Awareness%3A-Org%2C-Team-%26-Projects-Docs) I put together for Brian’s onboarding docs, but thats probably plenty for a start.
