#### What was the History
- April 2021: arrived and sense of "Climbing mountains and exhaused"
- Intro planned by boggie after a hard year for the organization
	- matt been orienting product team for 1 yr; before focusing on engineering
		- focus on squad structure
		- PMs oriented around customer needs
			- eg toxic PM relationship with stakeholder
	- Through that year, a full tech replatforming AND digital only redesign; [[upstatement]] designers
		- Lots of artifacts, creative brief, mini site, first design system
		- "digital first presentation" - very "feeds and cards"
			- Triggers Newsroom to hire digital editors who will make all sorts of story cards. Engineering only delivers 2 types. Burns Patrick.
	- New publisher same time: Performance management and annual review priority
	- Temple Audit
	- [[Inq4All]]
- Lost key product staff after folks kinda broke themselves
	- PM for mobile
	- PM for reader experience - had been Band Manager + key PM for whole redesign
- Had 2 parallel efforts for whole PDE org: Inq2 and Not Inq2
	- eg folks would put everything under the Inq2 banner to get it done
	- 2 key Outcome post-project wrapup:
		- Said "Need cross-PM process with shared backlog"
		- Needed REAL audience connection
- Becky's role: Product Led Newsroom requires a Journalist as leader
	- Pre-matt predecessor came from comcast
- Legacy newsroom tech:
	- pockets of the newsroom embody excellence and live it out.
		- Award winners (feature award winners, investigations, book authors)
			- wendy rudeman and barbara lake - pulitzer winners for busted
- Org alignment & 2021 goals: org-wide goals were new to the org
	- Cross PM prioritization laddered up to org, PMs weren't feeling sense of connection to wider organization
	- Outcomes Over Output: Gift to organization
		- Workshops with PDE, Sales, Marketing, newsroom, leadership
		- Tools to connect goals with the work: aligning the work with strategy
			- shared language and way to envision new work
			- "what do we need to do to have more people in Philly coming to our website?"
		- [Brand Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17njz7RcEd-lXcANMklDlvIEOIRTkyxTG/view)
	- Cross departmental collaboration:
		- Revenue departments have vertical processes to come up with something that goes to all the way up to Pete, then shared out to partner teams (e.g. marketing playbook)
		- 90 minute sync is perfectly indicative of this behavior of "agile within silos departments"
			- Pete joined early 2021, [[Darya Ushakova]] joined soon aftger and turned it all around
			- Marketing is now an engine on their own
				- Implementing Martech they're comfortable with to beat goals
			- #retention
				- industry best practice isn't good
				- Nither tech nor media orgs have this figured out
				- Break down pockets of excellence
	- Newsroom Product Sync: Mondays at 11:30
		- Ray Boyd, TJ Furman,
		- Not updates
	- Internal org surveys: talk to nicole Henninger
		- she's been attempting to unite surveys internal and external
		- Prior customer attempt was shut down due to no x-department user research strategy
		- THIS IS THE BIG OPPORTUNITY!
### News / Product Sync
- People:
	- [[TJ Furman]] - Newsroom Workflow Genius
- Format:
	- All PMs, all Digital Editors, Julia
	- 30 minutes mondays, taking the place of lots of 1:1's
	- "how can we help each other"
- [Notes](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PD/pages/1530691627/Newsroom+Product+Sync):
	- People confused about getting onto distribution lists (groups.google.com)
		- [x] #tasks Sign up for all the newsletters âœ… 2021-12-27
	- Each team / each desk to get a digital editor; lots of new hiring. Not there yet.
	- Photos and alt-text aren't commonly used in the newsroom
		- Workflow starts in FTP; would need to map fields in files on photographers machines, preftp, pre-DAM
		-
### Analytics Standup
- [[Daniel McNichol]] Handoff
	- #retention handoff
		- don't have a great way to report on retention
		- we'll likely own key aspects of retention, but nobody within [[Analytics Team]] is owning this.
- [[Analytics Team]] Jira Portal Requests
	- #question [[Mark Loomis]] What's utilization of the team Jira desk like? What do bad requests look like? What's the customer experience like?
	- Support tickets need to get moved manually.
### [[Julia Haslinger]] team interview
- had previously done similar work on a consulting basis
	- did first 3 months here's what you should do; but now afraid of how to see it through
		- "data shows you should do x", but what if it doesn't work and data doesn't show it
	- Focus of newsroom analytics:
		- Didn't want to be a reporter, but wanted to work in news, and use love of maths
		- Her dad was managing editor of a paper, so saw him pouring over spreadsheets, budgets, layoffs, and lots of evaluation to change direction of a paper
			- undergrad for newspaper design at Mizzou
				- design prof mentor became community engagement head for local paper
		- Was a web producer for launch of Politico Pro
			- built her own database of CMS tracking since nobody sent her access to anything
			- "you can use data to help editors do their jobs better"
- "most people in journalism want to make the journalism that needs to be made and get in front of people"
- [Structured interviews of newsroom](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/1780121630/Julia+intro+to+editorial+staff+conversation+themes):
	- Questions:
		- where are you getting your numbers?
	- Not uncomfortable with data, BUT don't have a baseline
		- patrick doesn't want to allow baseline development
	- Most editors understand their things are top of funnel, other things are subscriber only / bottom of funnel
	- Most editors say want more guidance of what to do about the data
		- BUT their colleagues say that's just them saying what others want to hear
	- Most (desklevel) want to use data to figure out what to do with stories that already exist:
		- e.g. should we make subscriber only, when to publish, how to put on homepage
		- NOT: changing story format, how much we publish
	- Editors want data to back them up (stop doing this type of story that's not doing great)
		- Want to advocate for themselves and think data will back them up
	- Everyone misses Parsely
		- chartbeat used a lot for a lot of things but not as loved
	- Only dashboard that gets used daily - to see what stories converted stories into subscribers
	- Emails:
		- Megan Griffith Greene - Editor for Service Desk sends weekly summary email about evergreen and service content
		- Newsletter editor does EXTRAORDINARY 12 page analysis report every month. It's amazing
- knowledge exchagne:
	- every team has a locked channel in slack for work and gossip
		- nobody can get between the water coolers except Pat - digital editor - who moves between them all
	- some channels are nice (arts and crafts, cooking channels, pets channels)
- Previously this job reported to Patrick and Ross, but they still have prioritization power
- DM me to figure thigns out, not just service them
	- got a bunch of dms including interactives editor
- challenges
	- don't know enough to know for sure
		- have some heresay
			- Fatigue about number of places to get data
			- displeasure of not being able to access data they used to get (e.g. through Parsely)
			- Frustration or misunderstaning about what the company thinks is important ("the company keeps changing its mind about whats important. Pageviews, then engagement, then conversions. What's actually important?") -> What's The Key Metric keeps changing
			- People notice the numbers don't match between what they see in one dashboard vs a meeting update vs an email
		- Wish more data were more available to more people
			- wish data were more structured in ways that make sense
				- building her own article production dataset - daily first, then hourly
				- Practice within analytics team to only take first byline in multi-biline stories
					- Challenge of "Now" desk - never gets first byline, which is where we have our young reporters and reporters of color
						- undercounting how much women and poc are being used in analytics to 
						  
						  How did we get here with challenges?
- People in each department were making things work for their department and wasn't a unified... nobody setting definitions. Nobody saying "this is what this word means" (e.g. conversions), "we're going to use pageviews instead of sessions or meterstops in this way."
	- Each department was able to make due with what they had so there wasn't a need to unify things across ^bia6rq
		- how we got martketing that didn't match editorial and finance
	- Even [[Analytics Team]]: Who on analytics handles circulation? Finance has their own analysts. No shared glosaries, definitions, or resources because everyone can make due on their own.
	  
	  Untapped opportunities:
- Getting more people to people excited to use the data
	- eg one editor who's a reason for friction: she and news editor don't get along. Other people said: been antagonistic about data. Had most telling quotes. "We can't do top 10 ways to prepare tofu. we cover tne news".
		- yet had most actionable types of data requests of ways she wanted to use data
		- she'll still be a PITA to the digital editor, but could give her this to help with other things on her tam and build goodwill
	- Even if its a PITA because its a one-off it earns tons of goodwill
	- have questions they want data to answer and it's not hte same for everybody
	  
	  
	  How to do that:
- hopefully just what she's going to do
	- ticket everything out with mark, have patrick prioritize, and just do em all
	- trick to get the data to do those analyses, which hopefully a solvable problem, then make sure have time to do them
- Dave: How to balance that out with longtime:
	- newsroom hiring digital editors. Eventually embedded on each desk. Eventually form strategies. They'll be the ones to take the data to the editors. Empowering editors to do the analysis. Digital strategy leads for desk
	- fusion of strategic role and newsroom management role
	  
	  
	  How to spend time:
- 6 months to a year: cleanup
	- systems have structure and make sense
	- things not getting used go away
	- QAing a ton of shit; making sure numbers match, and deciding what one to use wnen they don't
	- setting definitions
	- setting up data governance
	- when teh company sets goals, make sure they're measuirable and measurable faster than the change it's measuring
- but really where SHOULD:
	- figuring out where data literacy is an issue and best ways to address that
		- where do people misunderstand the data? Most dangerous part of data work.
		- Are they interpreting them correctly.
## Reflections:
The Inquirer's going from an organization which is used to operating in silos toward a cross-functional one with shared priorities. We're not there yet, so that's leading to a state of split-brain where folks have hard times getting things done. The Outcomes over Outputs approach matches our organizational maturity well for this moment. Our next milestone will be outgrowing it.

As [[Julia Haslinger]] noted in our [[#Julia Haslinger team interview]],
each vertical department was able to make due with non-aligned approaches since they didn't need to operationally work with other teams when it came to non-aligned figures [[2021-12-13#^bia6rq]]. Things were super vertical, with Finance having gtheir own in-house analysts, and Marketing owning the whole marketing playbook, then sending it out to Product after the VP signed off on things. Responsibility was purely jurisdictional.

This also explains a bit about why we don't see explicit "Ownership" across [[Product, Design, and Engineering]]. Teams didn't have to track and broadcast what they were responsible for and what sort of lifecycle status a particular effort/project/system might have. That kind of support lifecycle was just carried forward out of jurisdictional momentum of "x should do this". This leads to personal project support where individual labors of love carry things far, but impactful things are often forgotten about when individuals can't support it.

Likewise, we also see challenges in organization wide prioritization for these same reasons. W ecould talk about org wide goals before, but couldn't serve both the high level biz goals plus departmental nuances; instead gave over to departmental centers of gravity. This is why everyone's allowed ot have a top priority, but we're not stack ranking company priority. There's not broadcast of priority or context. It's just "context for context's sake", leading to lots of noise. This noise makes collaboration hard
