# ðŸ““Daily Log

## [[Matt Boggie|Matt]] #meeting

- [[Subscriber data warehouse]]
	- What's the status?
		- Functional data unification

	- Mix of lots of ways to get there + roadblocks
- People here respond best when presented with an option



## [[Analytics Team]]
- [[Sarah Jarvis]] in [[PDE Stakeholders]] #meeting: she _believes_ web traffic is down last week because we sent fewer news alerts last week. Knowing that with certainty would be good.

## [[Hiring#2021Q1 Data Engineer Hiring]]
- [[Motion Recruiting]]
	- Kelly takes liberties - skirts internal recruiting and goes straight to HMs
	- Salary changes at the end; she's incentivized for 10-20k more
	- #decision: Putting a delay between booking and technical assessment


### Candidate: Eva von Weltin
- how do I make the data so available that others ask less questions, so that they can ask the questions they want to ask
	- how'd you make that happen?
		- high quality documentation as consistent part of dev cycle & committing to whole projects to ensuire documentation.
		- biggest thing to make accessible = dbt
			- had been building own end-to-end etl library with custom tool; had been difficult to update the data model. Difficult for folks who didn't write data model to understand how transformations happened.
			- Going beyond the idea of the "Perfect Model of the data" to instead having lots of views of it
- Previously ran a lab at temple: neuro lab for open EEG data
	- company had been trying to build open data platform
		- built an electronic data caputre sustem for Michael J Fox foundation for parkinsons
		- Platform went back to Penn
	- Study to find people who don't have parkinsons, but could soon
- how to improve data model
	- worked with clinicians and associate clinical leads
		- filled out the forms and processes for each clinical visit to process each form
		- analyzed process of old data and hard to understand for researchers
		- Created new data capture mechanisms; how to ask questions better to get better experiences and data
			- built logic into forms to help people not put in erronious data
			- Used that to every form
	- Building tests and checks on top of the forms
	- ensuring that data in dataset comes to analysis
