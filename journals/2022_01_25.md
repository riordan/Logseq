# üì∞ Meeting Log
## [[Brown Institute]] [[Local News Lab]] DEI for INQ Recomendation system ML workshop
- Recomendation metrics:
	- Suggested metrics from Brown
		- Source Diversity: Reporters loging attributes fo sources
		- New vs. return visitor engagement
		- Rural vs. urban engagement
		- Audience health survey (survey users to recommend articles)
		- Geographic diversity
		- Date or freshness of articles
		- Topical variety
			- diverse amount of stories and keep them engaged on site
		- FEEDBACK:
			- The audience we have is not the audience we want to have
				- we care about serving a local audience
			- Missing a performance metric: e.g. a CTR on the feed
			- "Audience health metric"
				- is this affecting you in your own life and neighborhood

- we all do things our own way and make it up as we go
	- e.g. scrape covid data - I'll do aws and dpeloy in labmda, i'll do in github actions, i'll do it in heroku
		- never had any sort of unified thing
	- painpoints:
		- scraping and storing the data
			- Getting and storing from somewhere else is a constant challenge; been THE major one.
			- No SOP for how we do an automated job
		- Internally presenting the data for reporters.
			- Covid Data: At the end it's getting spit out as a Google Sheet
			- shouldn't be a sql queries or csvs on github
			- The I-Team is using Pandas; planning a workshop on using Pandas (Data Catalog)
				- using it for content search
				- "Search a name and everywhere it pops up"
					- see them in the voter roll and real estate data
				- Dylan Purcell and Chris Williams are the ones dealing with that
				- "need to background a person" - powerful feature. Doesn't power analysis
				- For most people in the newsroom that's useful, but not something for the data teams
		- Datateams changing get a new voterroll every week.
			- question: how's the geography of dem vs r changing week to week
				- which towns are turning bluer over time redder over time
				- which are independent
				- watching this over time - which are adding R week to week
				- write the code and loop it every week
				- "How is a geography changing" is a core question that applies to things like Real estate sales
					- Not necessarially hotspot tracking
					- Business licenses, restaurant inspections: hey we have data on something that happens every week; how do I start to see how that changes over time.
						- something's happened in this neighborhood; something's STOPPED happening in this neighborhood
						- monitoring AND alerting
					- Housing data once a week, pings in slack when something's crazy
- The desk
	- 2.5: 2 reporters + an intern
	- Enterprise journalism
		- 3 weeks, not 9 months, not 1 day
		- Mosly stories of we crunched numbers and analysis found a thing (or we couldn't analyze it and why that's bad)
		- "An inquirer analysis shows this is a thing, this is happening, this is a problem"
			- e.g. rapid tests w/ census data and poverty. More than 4 in a household, so mailing 4 rapid tests can't test a whole family at once
				- as the poorest big city in america thats a big problem for us
			- Care about poverty - powerful lens
			- might take a few weeks to pull together - asking questions and looking at datasets
				- "hey biden admin's mailing out 4 to a household, who's getting left out? Site's only in english or spanish, who's getting let out" Start finding proxies to answer the question
			- Might do EDA on campaign finance data
				- better questions: which candidates have the most overlap in donors. Where do the bernie donors give now
- Don't do exploratory tools most of the time. having the exploratory tool inside the story
	- e.g. sports wants to rank sixers players over time
		- could rank em, readers could pick metrics they care about and weight em
		- "we're doing the same thing over and over. can we make a tyhingh where we let people rank and sfort be a thign we apply to many different things"
# Daily Log
## Data PM
Annie as data PM?
Cons:
- What's her PM expertise here?
- Would this be useful at all for her career and serve her well?
- Would she be able to deliver this in terms of a data program?
## [[mz]]
- Used MTM dashboard for the presentation - was updated by HR and Mark, revenue wasn't updated
	- Never a sehedule or project plan
- way to get broader adoption is showing it to people
- Distribution and maturity to use it
	- For practical matters: we're now workign on newsletter dashboard to sort by this because it's useful
- Don't have to go upstream - won't find anything new useful there
	- rest of the folks have to be taught or led to metrics, aren't clamoring for it
- Start where we've got a good start and focus on maximizing utility
	- Patrick's a big user, dan and ross are big users
	- marketing team's a big user (everyone under darya)
	- Finance is its own animal
		- belief that things have to integrate
			- finance has numbers they need in a way they want em
- [[Subscriber data warehouse]]
	- we have 3 product lines
		- 7 day print subscribers
		- sunday only subscribers
		- Other physical delivery (FOD's) - to be rolled into 7 or Sunday
		- Digital
	- Segments:
		- under 2 years = high churn
		- over 2 years = very low churn
- Utility of done (get from Darya):
	- All-digitals stuck in DSI
	- Digitally active print
		- difference between digital activated and digitally active
			- know who they are if digitally activated
			- some use our digital product but most don't
	- lowest priority to bring over are non-activated print
