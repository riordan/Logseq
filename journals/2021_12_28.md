This feels like a throwback to your last conversation with [[Matt Boggie]] where he mentioned we stop delivery immediately and so try to do the same for digital subs, and therefore make restatements in order to do that, creating a complex crediting system.

#### [[Data Platform]] #questions:
- Should we be going straight to BigQuery for everything? Should we be building an intermediate layer Data Lake for source data (as Parquet or Avro) for disaster recovery,
- What kind of monitoring tooling do we need / want in place?
	- System-level
	- Data level (data acquisition success, data integrity, data validity)
	- Service level
- - What should the relationship between GCP service data infra and AWS Compute Infra be?
	- Will we need to help the company think about multi-cloud operations? (Probably). Where do we start?
	- How will this affect our relationship to service monitoring?
- How should we handle permissions and access controls:
	- for individuals
	- For data protection, security, PII
	- For datasets created by folks outside DE/Analytics
- How should we handle data retention? For storage, for security.
- Do we build ourselves some tooling to radically streamline data source acquisiton and set up others for successsful downstream uses?
- Who are our key customers for our data platform?
	- What are their immediate needs?
	- Short term needs?
	- What are the new problems our progress and success will create for them?
- Tell me about what you were working on before. The high level problems, the customer challenges, and nuanced problems that emerged over time.
