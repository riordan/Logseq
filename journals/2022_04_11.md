- #Reflection: We do not have our resources well organized in [[Data and Insights]]
	- Today, [[Matt Boggie]] reached out to me about [[KPIs]] dashboards for 2022. I couldn't find it.
	- **It's our responsibility** to get these KPIs updated and visible and available to the whole company. We're failing at that.
- Priorities:
	- Getting a KPI Dashboard #Priority/High
- meetings:
	- [[Kim Rossmair Johnson]] #meeting/1:1
		- LATER Need to meet Suzanne from [[inquirer/legal]]
			- handles people well who want to push the envelope
			- Working on email opt-out issues
		- [[Salesforce]] Campaigns: Not yet using
			- Needs to figure out how to get [[Devin]] to run the thing so that he can run the imports

- LATER #Logseq Figure out how to use text expansion for ios to act as a templating tool thats the same between your ipad and desktop logseq; use that to set up your weekly and daily planer in Logseq.
