Nothing major right now  

-   subs data project
-   Kate fulfilled a newsletter team request that might be of interest - it was a newsletter lead -> subscription conversion data pull

I'd like to know what is happening with  
-   registration plans
-    Piano premium content algorithm

Flagged:
- Data downtime still having an effect on events. Bill's not convinced we're capturing all premium subscription events.
	- #priority Data Downtime
		- [ ]  #task Need a Data Downtime problem sheet ‚è≥ 2022-01-26
- Mather: Pricing new customers Who *not* to price. There are some people moving from 399-599 we're losing them.
	- apple pay: wanted to launch apple pay months ago, don't have apple pay checkout available
		- running into issues with Braintree and Recurly. Have a noncompete with Braintree
	- 
- [[rachelc]] - Mather churn prediction
	- Huge file to get on a weekly basis to target subscribers differently based on engagement
	-
