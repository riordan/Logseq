### Conversation / Meeting Notes
#### [[Todd Gillespe]]
- Data PM Update
- Metrics that Matter - what happened? How to restart.
	- Lots of the folks involved in [[Metrics That Matter]] / [[Subscriber data warehouse]] were doing the work on replatforming to Salesforce
- Governance challenges
	-
	- Web and engineering
		- 2 years; lots of changes. Process was never cannonized. Never thought to coordinate and improve until Becky showed up.
			- Becky: We need a process for prioritization, engineering is ad-hoc. Can we align these so eng is in alignment with product development.
			- Became operational in September, running faster. [[Ben Deane-Schierloh]] making this coordinated in Jira
			- Staffed up engineers at that same time. (How has that experience)
		- Chalenges of expertise & bus factoring:
			- Lots of folks leaving, where new members are overwhelmed and SUDDENLY responsible for another 7 systems essential for business to make money right now, which keeps them from making the investment to where things can get more productive overall
			- "Doing anything beyond putting out fires is a herculean effort."
				- Was told SF would be migrated between interviews and when he started (in that quarter), and that the engineers would become a core data team. Those engineers stayed on salesforce for 2 years. [[Jim Anton]] was potentially one of those
					- [[Jeremy Beha]] left. Took on engineering and product ownership of it. Took a ton of experise with him. Led decisions about this in conversation with others.
					- Me: "If only one person can do it, the company isn't doing it."
	- PM as a Stakeholder / consumer of analytics
		- Wanted to be self-serve, but bespoke knowledge to his needs has been easier to ask for it from [[Analytics Team]], and often [[Mark Loomis|mark]], rather than debriefing with data team
			- how to get access
			- how to clean it
			- how to work with it
			- Hasn't been worth it for [[Todd Gillespe]] since moved from thing to thing
				- having a reason to invest in BQ
			- Don't want to waste engineers time
			- "the place where that knowledge lives, involves someone wasting someone elses time. But there's nothing stopping me from dropping into analytics team office hours to learn it." **DATA DISCOVERY**
			- Experiment: Launched a new mobile feature to follow a specific sports section. Follow data -> DynamoDB -> BQ.
				- Feature: ability to customize content you want to see as a customer. Set up on First-time-user-experience workflow, but almost never go back and refine their feed.
				- Changes happening in analytics tooling & firebase. Not clear what the flow is into Data Studio.
				- BQ work must be bespoke. Data studio isn't good at reuse
					- Other PMs may have had a better reuse experience [[julie westfall]] and [[nadya]] who's been doing revenue
				- **don't want to step on toes and make people feel like they're not doing a good job. mark is so busy that to ask him to deliver a simple dashboard vs spend the time so I can ask that very simple question**
					- Equipping mid-level managers of authority
						- Shortlist:
							- PMs
							- Digital Editors ([[dan hirshhorn]])
							- New folks on Marketing team ([[Nadya Tan]], [[Sarah Jarvis]], [[Kim Rossmair Johnson]] group - email marketing)
						- new digital strategy editor joining
						- others who left in the last year who could have been good
							- Jessica Parks --> Product Director at Hearst
								- Innovation in newsroom
								- owned tools for newsroom. Keystone for newsroom to tech bridge
								- Any time she built a new special project (waas like a features editor) and would need specific analytics. (e.g. college ROI). Had its own succes criteria metrics.
								- Jessica and her lieutenent (Lexi) left in Q4. Backfilling 3-4x. Digital desk under [[dan hirshhorn]] rebuilding this now.
								- [ ] #task Talk to [[dan hirschhorn]] about digital desk
		- [[Data Quality]] = Usability of data content, Validity (trust) of data content (accuracy and consistency), and reliability / consistency of delivery. Ideally resilliant to system change
- Adblocking
	- Twitter Blue partnership
		- If you have an adblocker on, you need to sign up for Twitter Blue to visit our site adfree
	- [[Mark Loomis|mark]] has done some work to investigate adblocking percentages
	- [[google optimize]] and [[Blueconic]] are both blocked by privacy trackers and ad blockers
- Feed Logic
- Tod wants: Data Engineers & Product work
	- wants to have DE's work on user-facing features
#### finalizing 2021 audience numbers & targets for 2022 forecast
- Attendees:
	- [[michael zimbalist]]
	- [[Mark Loomis|mark]]
- #gsheet [2022 audience goals & forecast](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wXhkhWb15CQiK4OmXwSfdPuPnAuQ_YBP_Lwd4x5IKqE/edit#gid=34070579)
	- Not a timeseries methodology
	- Can't really do formal historical timeseries due to pandemic spikes and protests. 2020 was way high
	- Instinctually believes that seasonality behaviors have changed.
- Newspaper works on Weekly calendar vs Monthly Calendar. Trying to move away from this.
	- Finance does it that way. 5th week every 3rd month
	- [ ] #task Announce deprecation to reporting moving from Periods -> Months 🛫 2022-01-26 ⏳ 2001-01-02 📅 2022-01-28
		- public announcement of deprecation of financial months
- [x] #task Book Followup for [[2022-01-05]] with zimbalist and mark 🛫 2022-01-04 ⏳ 2022-01-04 📅 2022-01-05 ✅ 2022-01-12
	- Is there a methodology to refine this well and quickly?
	- End of year, got final numbers for [enterprise goals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wXhkhWb15CQiK4OmXwSfdPuPnAuQ_YBP_Lwd4x5IKqE/edit#gid=249983188):
