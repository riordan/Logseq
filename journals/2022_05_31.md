- Today I plan to
	- Talk to George about Okta in datahub & nested groups / permission-based groups
	- Run the DSI fact table session
- Today I did:
	- [[Laura Gordon]]
		- Prepping for difficult conversations
			- What is my goal?
				- Have more time to myself, especially when needed or "engaged", both for work and for self-care.
			- How could this help me
				- More capable, confident, and without the feeling of impending doom over my shoulder when it comes to work.
			- 5-to-1 ratio: 5 positive/1 negative interaction for successful relationships
