		  Some additional context here: we‚Äôd initially prioritized this because 
		  @Julia Haslanger
		   was working on a short-term project which very much could have used this data.
		  Since they were already using an event-based approach to incrementally update us via the slackbot in #premium-contents, I suspected it might be quick(er) for them to extend that same notification infrastructure already in place and send the same payload to a webhook. To that end, Stitch (a data loader provider we use) offers a webhook-based source: POST a JSON object (with a constant schema) to an endpoint and it‚Äôll add that incremental event directly to BigQuery. This way, both Mather  & we wouldn‚Äôt have to implement much to do this integration.
		  They seem to have taken this as more of a ‚Äúgeneral request we‚Äôll get to eventually‚Äù as opposed to the intent for expediency. They wouldn‚Äôt have had to build an automated batch delivery system; they could have just set it to POST the same JSON object going to the slackbot to a second URL.
		  If they want to do a more traditional hourly or daily batch pickup mechanism that‚Äôs more like some of the other Vestapol integrations we‚Äôve done, it‚Äôs absolutely a viable option too. It means it‚Äôll be operationally identical to many of our existing 3rd party data source integrations (Vestapol, orchestrated by Airflow, delivering the data to GCS, then onto BigQuery). Speed of integration and delivery isn‚Äôt mission critical but it does have the potential to offer us some potentially useful properties.
		  The alternative with Stitch has more significant upsides and more significant downsides:
		  Upsides
		  Next to nothing to build on our end; add the new source in Stitch (at no incremental cost; The Inquirer pays for an unlimited plan), then set up a DBT Source for when it lands in BigQuery
		  Instant updates: we would get updates in BigQuery at the same time the newsroom is making the decision of whether or not to make the story premium. This gives us the potential to do more with event-based notifications.
		  It‚Äôs another thing that‚Äôs running in Stitch; even though we don‚Äôt really love Stitch (more on that below). We get the advantages of instant delivery without building our own bespoke infra, that‚Äôs only being used by this one project at this time.
		  Downsides
		  It‚Äôs got to stay on - webhooks require we pick up the events as they happen; so Stitch downtime = missed events. We‚Äôd probably need them to hand-export stuff every few months anyway and re-ingest to make sure we don‚Äôt miss any stories.
		  We don‚Äôt really love stitch. It‚Äôs already used to replicate 26 different data feeds, both super important sources that get a lot of use (like Salesforce Marketing Cloud emails and Auth0 logins) and ones that don‚Äôt (AppAnnie, our Shopify).
		  It‚Äôs expensive ~30kUSD/yr. and we‚Äôre stuck with the Unlimited version because it‚Äôs used in the replication pipeline for Salesforce Marketing Cloud, yet that pipeline can ONLY do complete replications, so every night we‚Äôre copying years worth of sends. (averages ~350MM rows/month despite our send rate growing at a fraction of that.) This is what puts us in the Unlimited tier.
		  Despite being a service that has a lot of pre-build connectors to things like Shopify, FB Ads, Google Ads, etc. most of our integrations are still homegrown and at this point understood really only by 
		  @Hanson
		  . Some of them are picking up things from S3->Stitch->BQ. Some also go from AWS Lambda -> AWS DynamoDB -> Stitch->BQ.
		  Because there isn‚Äôt broad visibility and understanding of the data delivery infrastructure coming through and upstream of Stitch, we likely will want to move off of Stitch over the long-term, but is acceptable for now. This isn‚Äôt worth the scramble of trying to port over every data pipeline before October (when our contract renews). Adding one more source coming from Stitch (and one that‚Äôs less dependent on our own AWS maintained infra than most pipelines there) won‚Äôt be such a bad thing if we take this path.
		  That said, going with a tried and true ‚ÄúPick up a file from an FTP or directly from a bucket using Airflow‚Äù isn‚Äôt a bad path either.
		  This is a lot more context than you likely need or want for the Mather problem, but does lay out more of the background and possibilities of what we might do. (edited)
	- ### [[Home Delivery Modeling Tool]] data delivery
	  collapsed:: true
		- [[Jim Anton]] has been trying to move the data export from the [current complex, multi-system, process](((62b9ea6c-d77f-4f50-8565-8bcb77e09fef))), using [[Informatica]], however the Google Drive + GCS Connector requires paid add-ons.
		- Mark Ganslaugh suggesed we use a Google Drive as FTP plugin. No.
		- We already use a tool called [[MoveIT Central]] in conjunction with the MSSQL Reports [[Mario (Reporting Server)]] to export reports out of the company.

		- ### Agenda
			- Context and Objectives(5 mins)
				- Takeaways:
					- We've got the opportunity to create a shared vision of our company culture
						- How might we move away from silos and act more cohesively
					- Looking at Myself (Leaders), My Team, The Company
						- Across the board; the culture is the biggest thing Leads believe the company needs improvement on.
							- People Management is the one common Top3 for Self, Team, Company
						-
				- Objective: Emerge from this workshop with insights into three key focus areas for the Leadership Team.
					- Creating the Culture We Want.  What is it about the present state of the company that makes us feel suspicious and untrusting?  What concrete steps might we take to move to a future state that is more cohesive and collaborative?  How can leadership cascade and reinforce these steps with their teams?
					- Ourselves, Our Teams, and The Company.  What is the cause of the disconnect that leaders perceive between the performance of themselves, their teams, and the company?  Why is it that we see The Company as needing much more improvement than any of its parts?  How important is it to close that gap, and how might we accomplish this?
					- **Communicating and Collaborating.**  How can we strengthen communication both within, and between, departments?   Journalism is our business whether we work in the newsroom or not.  How can we strengthen the relationship between the newsroom (at the desk level, and the project level), and other parts of the organization in service of a more cohesive company?

			- ![Pre-read.pdf](../assets/Leadership_Meeting_Pre-read_1656343573596_0.pdf) Review and Discussion (15 mins)
			- Breakout sessions ‚Äî the core of the meeting (40 mins)
				- {{embed ((62bb2f45-3680-43af-b8de-897ad89e465e))}}
					- Evaluating the premise. Newsroom is "A Department" but not the only place this comes up from. What would it look like if were were looking more cohesive
						-
					-
				-
			- Session read-outs (25 mins)
				- [[mz]]: Our future is being held back by our past. Still super print oriented. feels like something being "Hidden". Don't put goals up in those areas
					- ME: Something _IS_ being hidden; we aren't upfront about the current trajectory of how and when we're tackling the "Managed Decline of print". Some of this is presented to the board, we should be upfront about this so teams can be empowered to factor this strategy in.
			- Wrap-up and next steps (5 mins)
