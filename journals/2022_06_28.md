		- ### Agenda
			- Context and Objectives(5 mins)
				- Objective: Emerge from this workshop with insights into three key focus areas for the Leadership Team.
					- Creating the Culture We Want.  What is it about the present state of the company that makes us feel suspicious and untrusting?  What concrete steps might we take to move to a future state that is more cohesive and collaborative?  How can leadership cascade and reinforce these steps with their teams?
					- Ourselves, Our Teams, and The Company.  What is the cause of the disconnect that leaders perceive between the performance of themselves, their teams, and the company?  Why is it that we see The Company as needing much more improvement than any of its parts?  How important is it to close that gap, and how might we accomplish this?
