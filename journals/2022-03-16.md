# 📓Daily Log

## [[Operational Excellence]] Leadership Check-in

Lisa: Start with the outcome. What's the project; whatre we working toward, whats the outcome
Understanding audience and ground them and start at the beginning of the story; don't just jump into the middle

Presenter should have some agency in what they think is important (e.g. who the attendees are); what's most useful is if its on track, we don't need to talk much about it; corrective actions, decisions
Big Insights that shouldl be shared

Pete: need a similar surfacing mechanism for BAU work also

Check-in:
Change overview to outcome

MZ: Target - specificity about dates? Lydia: more about what trying to do

Do we define the word Division? We don't have a consistent list
- sometimes operations is part of finance, sometimes its its own division, sometimes transportation is a division
- Imagining no more than 8 or 9
	- finance
	- ops
	- Production + Distribution
		- e.g. physical production, cost reduction, logistics
	- Brand
	- Sales
	- Marketing
	- P&C
	- PDE

Person to talk about these should be Project Owner rather than PM

Matt: Role for Product, how and where does it report out?
e.g newsletters: is it product, is it newsroom, is it marketing, now there's an important sales part

PM + PO feedback loop to their management; how are they communicating back to their division head and key people

MZ: transitioning from Project to BaU. Close-outs and transitions. E.g. Naviga

![[2021-12-27#^gbu1lx]]
Data and Insights ensures the Philadelphia Inquirer has the resources, infrastructure, skills, and people to have speed and agility in our decision-making over time.

## [[Alexandra Williams]]
- looking for industry codes in Naviga; missing in the ones that were imported from prior system

[[naviga]] ui - phi.navigahub.com
- updating circulation rate cards
	- someone was asking for updated rates. We're updating the rate on preprints by 1.18% next q
	- Figuring out for sales reps:
		- goals, budgets, rep commissions; need to update 3 things across 3 different modules to get that report updated
- Informer: Reporting tool


## Spring Theory: CMU
- 2 sided marketplace for partnerships between academia and industry
	- Working w/ 25->30 university programs
	- 3-4 years w/ CMU
- Business model:
	- 10k per university opportunity
	- covers whole semester
	- ![[Pasted image 20220316131530.png]]

	-![[Pasted image 20220316131653.png]]
	- Running May 16-August 5
	- Meeting cadence is project specific; could be weekly, milestone based, whatever
	- August final presentation with handover
	- 

## marketing
### NCAA
Lower numbers than expected
Nuance with registration: Sometimes doesn't register a front-end event, depending on what tab they're on. That could be happening here. We do have the data in the back-end.

But especially for social sign on; if you click the social sign in, in log in tab, doesn't register sign-up event. From Sign-up button it works

![[Pasted image 20220316121826.png]]

The nulls are from "Sign In" with social but -> registered for real + ad blockers on
The blue nulls + others represent an upper boundary; null could be any other thing missing attribution


- Target news alerts
	- 15/wk - 3 day for programmatic budget
- ![[Pasted image 20220316134021.png]]
- Usually some stories drive conversions and pageviews; what's the value of hitting the hardwall and leaving. We're not making up for that
- Newsletter Ad Strategy:
	- Roughly 100k difference between list size -> actual send size
	- "why the send size is so much smaller than the data extension"
		- signs up for newsletter; have them for the data extension, but their MarketingCloud preferences have them opted out from recieving anything that's non-transactional
- If we ship the puzzle book, it's 250k revenue




## Dan Kirchner
- tried to run things out of the newsroom and disappointed it wasn't
- loves to inform & enable smart KPI driven work in an org
- Been in newsroom influincing digital subscriber biz
- python and pandas to pull datasets together

- marketing for the last few years
