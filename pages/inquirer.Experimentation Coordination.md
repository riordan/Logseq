- ## Project Approach
	- ### Problem:
		- Online Experimentation (e.g. A/B Testing) is a major practice for out
	- ### Problem Nuances
	- ### Concerns:
		- [[Liz Grace]] has been the primary coordinator of experimentation at The Inquirer, first as part of the PDE Analytics team for a long time
		-
- ## Project Notes
- [[2022/04/06]]
	- [[Liz Grace]] in [[marketing]] used to own [[experimentation]] for [[Analytics Team]] before moving over to marketing
		- she's on parental leave; current owner for [[marketing]] is [[Nadya Tan]]
	- ways we track stuff:
	- Platforms:
		- [[Piano]]
		- [[Blueconic]]
		- Optimize
			- Feature-focused testing:
				- moving module up or down the page; color of modals
				- NOT focused on registration/meter
		- [[inquirer/mobile app]] testing: Firebase remote config
			- custom system build by [[Bryan Deemer]]
		- Lists of tests have lived in a couple of different documentation systems
			- Optimize Jira
			- Smartsheet
			- Recaps of tests run in previous year on Google Drive
			- Confluence test pages
				- Analytics
					- [results](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/229046/Testing+Results)
					- [2021 testing roadmap mid-year review](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17CRCzWg3BUZ1j31s8tw-LY-TEXtY7MMwZOcDcskP0mQ/edit#slide=id.gdb77f633bb_0_38)
				- [Marketing]()
	- Challenges:
		- different platforms
		- fragmented communication
		- fragmented operations
		- not a lot of transparency
	- Analytics process:
		- Previously mark was managing with liz (as point of contact)
			- Kate managed some of the app stuff
			- liz handled optimize setup
			- mark and nat did piano marketing things
			- not liz
		- Current:
			- liz doing piano
			- nat gone: gap for marketing tests
				- kate does't ahve experience working in piano; nat handled it before. mark feels like he can take it on because he managed piano with nat
				- [[mark]] steps in because he has experience, but doesn't give kate a way to get experience
			- Not really a clear channel for where tests come from; mark figures he'll set it up and get it going and kate can analyze at the end
				- struggle of where the handoff is
			- The jira intake process is heavy because was designed to capture from folks in product, but not lightweight. We don't have a way lightweight capture requests and work tickets regardless of where they come from #fleeting #agile
	- What could we do:
		- Pull automated data from all known experiment/test sources
		- Visualize active experiment timelines
		- Post new experiments to a slack channel
		- Post a weekly update of all running (non-_permanent_) experiments
