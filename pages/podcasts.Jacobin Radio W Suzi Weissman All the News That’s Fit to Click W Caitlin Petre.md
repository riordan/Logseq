So all of a sudden you have that data and that data comes into newsrooms at this time when they are very vulnerable. Um and so the book is partly kind of a snapshot of that moment that I was observing. But then is also I think I hope serving as a case study through which we can understand these broader dynamics of what happens when all these digital analytics that can monitor and evaluate worker performance come into fields that we typically think of as being pretty autonomous in the way that work is carried out.

	  Speaker 1: you know, and this all leads to this whole question of I guess this word we use now surveillance capitalism. And I really want to have you explained as much as you can about that. And then I guess we'll go from there into this other wonderful thing that you bring in which is taylor ization. But can you just start with that as well. 
	  
	  Speaker 0: Absolutely. Yeah. So in the beginning of analytics kind of coming into news organizations, Most of the analytics tools that were used were analytics tools that had kind of been designed for an e commerce setting and then were transported into journalism. And so That was an awkward fit. And there was a lot of trepidation in newsrooms

	  Speaker 0: all the night of the 2016 presidential election, that was a real time data visualization, right, so sharp it is packed with, it did have a needle actually showing traffic how many people were currently on your news website, but then it also had a list of top pages. So what are the articles on your site that are getting the most visitors at this exact second? And that would be constantly shuffling as visitors would come into a story or leave a story. They also had metrics for engaged time. So this was a measure of how many people or rather how long the average reader spends on a site. And often this was less than a minute for a news website. And they also, I mean they got deeper than that. They also had metrics on strolled up. So this is showing how far down the page to most readers

You know, how much comes from facebook referrals, how much comes from google search, how much comes from someone coming directly to your website, right? And they're also able to show where people are in the world when they're coming to your website and all these sorts of things. So the data does get very granular, that's one thing that becomes very striking I think especially for sort of print newsrooms are written journalism, I won't say print because a lot of these places are online only. But that was very striking that granularity because print news had never had that before. And then the real time aspect of it turned out to be extremely important for journalists becoming pretty fixated on this dashboard and

So you could know well how many people bought this issue of you know newsweek off the newsstand but you wouldn't know at all at the story level what was drawing the most reader attention.

	  Speaker 0: Absolutely. I think that there's there's certainly a feedback loop that happens right? Where and I do the same exact thing if I see a story and most popular, especially if it's about something that seems like it maybe I wouldn't expect it to be very popular. I think well there must be something about this story that's compelling and so click. Right? So I think that there are those feedback loops and yeah, I think absolutely that one of the reasons why those lists are on news websites is to yeah, increase audience time spent, increased engagement. Hopefully if there's a story that's getting a lot of attention than you want people to share that on social media so that you bring in even more readers and get a wider reach for your story. Absolutely. So, yes, I think that is

And here I'm getting into Harry, Braverman is work where labor monopoly capital is his book, He wrote it in the seventies and this is brilliant and really interesting analysis of terrorism and Braverman says, it sort of does two things. So first it makes the labor process more efficient and more profitable, but it also does something called de skilling. So it basically diy skills the work Because what happens in scientific management during taylor is um is that the high level thinking of how the work is going to be organized and carried out falls almost entirely to the manager and then the workers of the company is sort of interchangeable cogs who are just delegated to do their specific micro tasks in the exact way prescribed by the manager.

	  Speaker 0: analytics and in journalism, these kinds of economic pressures that I spoke about a few minutes ago we start to see these taylor wrist or scientific management techniques come into fields where the workers have an expectation that they're going to have some degree of autonomy over their work because that work is artistic or its creative or it's writing right in the case of journalism And so those workers up until fairly recently had been relatively relatively insulated from this kind of scientific management that had bled into all these other fields. And then you start to see especially with the rise of digital analytics, you start to see these types of scientific management techniques come into fields like journalism or maybe like

	  Speaker 0: point, it's just amazing because it is this vision for the intense taylor ization of journalism. So what AOL calls the content generation process. Not writing the content generation process is broken up into these seven steps and each step has sub steps. Right? And so we see this as sort of exactly this breakdown of the a very high level cognitive work of journalism being turned into something much more road and much more standardized. And so it was that sort of transformation that was getting me really interested in metrics. But then because journalists have this expectation of some autonomy over their work, they find really interesting ways to challenge this or push back. And so one of the central argument in my book is that

It has to be a little bit more sneaky because otherwise the idea was that these journalists would completely revolt.

	  Speaker 1: I'd like you to go into that too. Like how important the clicks the profits the ads are to this metric revolution. And then you talk about the way that management involves workers in their own tailor ization. So in labor intensification and it's really hard to get your head around that and thinking about, you know your old view of what journalism is that you're writing. You first you go out and you do reporting and then you write and you can imagine deadlines that are terrible pressures. But there's other sorts of ways now that labor is intensified that you go into and you get them to identify explicitly with the processes that increase the traffic of the stories that are being produced.

	  Speaker 0: exception. You know, the times even had experimented with the same time Select and it didn't work out very well. And so they had not even really implemented or we're just implementing their paywall, which they have now. And so at that moment, most online news organizations were entirely advertising based, right? Their revenue is entirely dependent on advertising. And the times, you know, up until very recently, most of their revenue share did come from advertising as well. And it's just in the last 10 years that it's switched. So now most of their revenue comes from subscribers. That's a really big change. That was a really big deal. Right? So we have a media system that is really built up on advertising and that advertising is

	  Speaker 0: figure out well what makes this feel so addictive. And I argue that if you look at the literature on game design and video game design in particular, like digital games, sometimes you will see features of very compelling digital games that there are a lot of similarity to char pete and what this meant practically speaking was that journalists a cocker became very fixated on and mesmerized in some cases by chart beat and in so doing they start to try to boost their traffic on chart beat, not because of managers directly telling them that they have to do that, but just because they want to get a better score in this what I call the traffic gate and so,

So it's this very sort of individualized self blaming that happened, which was so striking to me because of course management is the one making this technology available to you. But so workers and doctors start to kind of extract increased productivity feeling like they're doing it to themselves. Like I need to get a higher score. So I'm going to write more posts because I know any post I write is going to get some traffic or I'm going to fiddle with this headline or I'm going to try tweeting this this morning as opposed to, you know, last night because maybe it'll get better play, right? So all of that is basically a work speed up or work intensification. They're working harder and harder and harder, but they don't feel

Um and it's not because of any explicit directive from management, it's because of the sharp, it is a tool that forms a relationship and often a very emotional relationship directly with the managed worker in this case the journalists. And so when I

And if they exceeded that traffic target as a collective site, they were eligible for a site level bonus, which then their editor decided to dispense as he or she saw fit, which is interesting and it's very different crucially different from writers get individual bonuses pegged directly to their traffic. Gawker had experimented with sort of pay for performance scheme and they ultimately abandoned it in favor of the system that they had at the time my research. So there was money on the table and it was kind of this pool of money that would accrue to your site rather than necessarily to you as an individual. But I think there

Like I was not the main front and center thing certainly was in their mind. But I think that they're just became actually a lot of them talked about a background in competitive sports. So they would say, you know, like I would say explain why you thrive in this metro sized work environment or or how you survive. And they would say, well, you know, I wrote competitive crew in college or whatever it was, I ran track. And so I remember this quote a writer named Eddie that's a pseudonym but he said something like I'm a very competitive person and that side of me was massaged into productivity by analytics. So you see that's just such a vivid quote to me

	  Speaker 0: so it becomes very hard to to ignore that when metrics are literally looming over you in your workspace. And it's potentially possible that part of this kind of Mindset that emerges in digital news organizations, that people were saying as early as early 2015 would never happen. You know, maybe there's some relationship there not to say that that's the main reason are the only reason. I think there's many other reasons why why this wave of unionization among these mostly young digital journalists occurred. But I think it's interesting to consider the way metrics really put front and center that journalists are yes, their knowledge workers, if we want to say that that's a category, but their workers nonetheless.

And so Gawker and the Times so different but they both use the same analytics tool, they both have sharpie subscriptions, their chart beat clients. So that was something that was really interesting to me is how does the same technology get taken up in these such different organizational and workplace context.

They want to be the barometer by which reporters evaluate the worth of their work and metrics are a threat to that. And so that's one of the reasons why there's a kind of hoarding of the data that happens. And that was sort of an interesting counter case to me because I was thinking, you know, if this is going to be in the newsroom to not be able to see it for your own work is arguably disempowering for you because you don't have full transparency about, You know, what you are bringing in or not bringing in.

It's not clear how to do that. And yet it's starting to come up in the way that were evaluated and therefore we want access to these numbers because they're there because they're circulating and so we need to have access to them. And so, you know, I think there's some cases in which writers were able to almost leverage data in ways that could give them some power or a greater degree of autonomy. It's a mixed bag. It's a really complex issue. And I yeah, it's not a simple story of total
