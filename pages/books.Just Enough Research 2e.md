Embrace these habits in all research and design work: Have a plan Provide a rationale for decisions Define roles and responsibility Set expectations Communicate progress Reflect on performance Anyone can encourage these behaviors simply by asking clarifying questions.

	  Groupthink happens when a team optimizes for the appearance of agreement to avoid dealing with a shared fear of confrontation. As Brown puts it, conflict allows teams “to acknowledge their lack of alignment and to work together to achieve a shared understanding.” Healthy conflict is essential to collaboration. Challenging design decisions makes them stronger.

	  Just Enough Rigor Professional researchers are not unlike journalists. While many people have sufficient skills to observe, analyze, and write, it’s allegiance to a set of standards that sets the pros apart. In addition to being professional and respectful in your work, there are just a few responsibilities to keep in mind.

	  2. Set realistic expectations A successful study is preceded by expectation-setting for everyone involved, including the questions to be answered, the methods to be used, and the decisions to be informed by the findings. This is particularly important when you need to request time or budget for the work. If your research doesn’t meet the expectations of the stakeholders, they will treat you like you’ve wasted time and money. Ask team members and managers what they hope for. Tell them what to expect.

	  3. Be prepared Research is like cooking: the better you prep, the faster and cleaner the work goes. If you don’t prepare, you end up with a huge mess and a kitchen in flames. Get your process and materials in order before you start. Set them up so they’re easy to reuse as needed.

	  4. Allow sufficient time for analysis You need a little time for things to click into place. After doing the research—or while still in the middle—it’s tempting to just forge ahead to solutions without giving yourself enough time to digest. Again, a bit more time here can save lots later on.

A single page could be enough.

	  To make the best use of your time and truly do just enough research, try to identify your highest-priority questions—your assumptions that carry the biggest risk. For example, given your stated business goals, what potential costs will you incur—what bad things will happen—if, six months from now, you realize: you are solving the wrong problem, you were wrong about how much organizational support you have for this project, you don’t have a particular competitive advantage you thought you had, or you didn’t see a particular competitive advantage before your competitor copied you, you were working on features that excited you but that don’t actually matter much to your most important customers, you failed to reflect what is most important to your users, your users don’t really understand the labels you’re using, you missed a key aspect of your users’ environments, you were wrong about your prospective users’ habits and preferences, or your product, service, or system can be misused in ways you didn’t consider?

Who from your side participated and in which roles?) Describe whom you spoke with and under which circumstances (number of people, on the phone or in person, etc.). Describe how you gathered the data. Describe the types of analysis you will be doing. Pull out quotes and observations. Group quotes and observations that typify a repeated pattern or idea into themes. For example, “participants rely on pen and paper to aid memory,” or “parents trust the opinions of other parents.” Summarize findings, including the patterns you noticed, the insights you gleaned from these patterns, and their implications for the design. Document the analysis in a shareable format.

Focus solely on that goal. Respect the structure of the session. Refrain from identifying larger patterns before you’ve gone through the data. Clearly differentiate observations from interpretations (what happened versus what it means). No solutions. It will be very tempting to propose solutions. Stick to insights and principles. Solutions come next.

	  In organizational research, the observer effect (how an observer’s presence can alter what is being observed) can actually be a force for positive change. Asking hard questions of people throughout an organization will force those people to come up with answers, leading to at least a modicum of reflection. Asking the same question of different people will reveal crucial differences in motivation and understanding. And listening to people who might not feel heard is a tremendous source of goodwill.

Include the following groups: Leaders will help you understand the overall company mission and vision and how your project fits into it. Managers will frequently be concerned with resource allocation and how your project affects their incentives, monetary or otherwise, and their ability to do the work. Subject matter experts will provide you with essential background information. You can find them by identifying those design-critical areas where you have the least background knowledge and by asking for introductions. The expertise you need may be outside the building.

	  In addition to name and title, these are the basic questions you’ll want to ask: How long have you been in this role? What are your essential duties and responsibilities? What does a typical day look like? Which people and teams do you work most closely with? How well is that relationship working? Regarding the project we’re working on, how would you define success? From your perspective, what will have changed for the better once it’s complete? Do you have any concerns about this project? What do you think the greatest challenges to success are? Internal and external? How do you expect your interactions with other people inside or outside this organization will change based on the outcome of this project? Then, there are the more specific questions that depend on the project. Stakeholders may themselves be users, often of backend systems or administrative functions: What are your most common tasks with the system? What problems have you noticed? What kinds of work-arounds do you use? Do you have any concerns about this project? Is there anyone else I should talk to?

To what extent does this stakeholder need to participate throughout the project, and in which role?

	  Problem statement and assumptions What needs to be solved or improved from a business perspective? Goals Every project begins with a rough set of goals, or concepts of success. Every individual in an organization sees them a little bit differently. Gathering these and reconciling them is essential to a functioning project. Success metrics What are the qualitative and quantitative measurements that tell you whether the project is hitting the mark? These should be meaningful criteria for evaluation that support the goals. Often, you will discover that part of the work to come is defining metrics. That is okay, and far better than picking the wrong ones because it’s easy. Completion criteria How will you know you’re done? It may seem obvious, but it’s always good to validate. Otherwise, the project will never be finished! Scope Scope refers to the amount of work included in any project. “Scope creep” is what happens when more work just keeps getting tacked on and the scope grows uncontrollably. The best way to avoid scope creep is to document what is included in as much detail as possible and in language everyone understands. And note who is responsible for what. Scope is a boundary, so it’s also very useful to note that which any of the stakeholders might assume to be included but is out of scope. Not touching the branding this time around? Write it down. Detailed scope documentation makes for happy teams and functional projects. Risks, concerns, and contingency plans Want to increase your chances of project success? Then acknowledge anything you’ve uncovered that might lead to failure or unmet expectations.

	  Mental model A mental model is an individual’s preexisting internal concept of, and associations with, any given institution, system, or situation. Every one of us has an imperfect, idiosyncratic map of reality in our head. Without it, we would be utterly lost. With it, we rely on assumptions based on previous experiences we consider analogous. The better the analogy, the more useful the map. This is why interfaces that strive for novelty are often unusable. With no hooks into an existing mental model, we have to figure things out from scratch. And that is very difficult.

	  Not all products need to be all things to all people. However, every design decision should be well-informed and intentional, welcoming your intended users rather than alienating or upsetting them. That’s why identifying and understanding your target audience or user base is the most important design research you will do.

	  You know what people want? People want to be liked. When you ask someone directly what they want, it is very possible the answer you receive will be what they think you want to hear, or the answer that reflects how they like to think of themselves. And because it’s impossible to want what you can’t imagine, you risk the scope of your ideas being limited by the imaginations of others.

	  You want to get to know a small but sufficient number of representative users very well. We’re typically talking a Vulcan mind meld with a handful of individuals, not a ten-question survey of a thousand families.

	  Fight the urge for control and get into the field where things are messy and unpredictable. (The field is wherever your target users generally are, anywhere from a cube farm to the London Tube.) As you’re probably well aware from how your day is going so far, life for everyone is messy and unpredictable in ways both good and bad.

	  Participant observation, whether done in person or remotely, is the name of the game. Everyone’s behavior changes with the context and the circumstances. Soak in your subject’s actual environment. It’s of limited utility to learn how people behave in your conference room. No one is going to act naturally in there. Even calling them in their own home or office is better.

	  Systematic analysis is the difference between actual ethnography and just meeting interesting new people at a networking event. You can use a light touch and a casual approach, but take enough time to gain some real understanding, and get your team involved in creating useful models.

	  Preparation Once you have established whom you want to talk to and what you want to find out, create your interview guide. This is a document you should have with you while you’re interviewing to ensure that you stay on topic and get all of the information you need. The interview guide should contain: The goal and description of the study: This is for you to share with the participant and use to remind yourself to stay close to the topic. Basic demographic questions: These are for putting the participant’s answers in context. They will vary depending on the purpose of the interview, but often include name, gender, age, location, and job title or role. Icebreaker or warm-up questions: These are to get the participant talking. Most people know this as “small talk.” Feel free to improvise based on the demographic information. The actual questions or topics: You know, the primary focus of the interview.

	  Nielsen’s ten heuristics (http://bkaprt.com/jer2/07-03/) are: System status visibility. The system should provide appropriate feedback. Match between system and real world. Use language familiar to the user and follow conventions. User control and freedom. Provide emergency exits, undo, and redo. Consistency and standards. Things that appear the same should behave the same. Error prevention. Don’t just let users escape from errors: help users avoid them. Recognition rather than recall. Options should be visible. Instructions should be easy to find. Don’t make the user have to remember information. Flexibility and efficiency of use. Support shortcuts for expert users. Aesthetic and minimalist design. Avoid providing irrelevant information. Help users recognize and recover from errors. Error messages should be helpful. Help and documentation. Ideally, the system should be usable without documentation, but help should still be available and task-oriented.

	  The advantage of heuristic analysis is that it’s a quick and cheap way to identify potential issues. You don’t need to recruit users. You can just get two colleagues to sit down and do it in an hour. It’s a good way to deal with obvious issues in early prototypes before bringing in users. The downside is that it’s very simplistic and may not catch every issue that would come up in context.

	  Cheap tests first, expensive tests later Usability testing can be more or less expensive. Don’t use expensive testing—costly in money or time—to discover what you can find out with cheap tests. Find out everything you can with paper prototypes or quick sketches before you move to a prototype. Find out everything you can in the comfort of your own office before you move into the field.
