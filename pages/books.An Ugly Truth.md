	  almost a week after their first date, he had access to it all. Facebook’s managers stressed to their employees that anyone discovered taking advantage of their access to data for personal means, to look up a friend’s account or that of a family member, would be immediately fired. But the managers also knew there were no safeguards in place. The system had been designed to be open, transparent, and accessible to all employees. It was part of Zuckerberg’s founding ethos to cut away the red tape that slowed down engineers and prevented them from producing fast, independent work. This rule had been put in place when Facebook had fewer than one hundred employees. Yet, years later, with thousands of engineers across the company, nobody had revisited the practice. There was nothing but the goodwill of the employees themselves to stop them from abusing their access to users’ private information.

	  according to the report Stamos presented, the company was “not technically or culturally prepared to play against” its current level of adversary. Worst of all, Stamos told them, was that despite firing dozens of employees over the last eighteen months for abusing their access, Facebook was doing nothing to solve or prevent what was clearly a systemic problem. In a chart, Stamos highlighted how nearly every month, engineers had exploited the tools designed to give them easy access to data for building new products to violate the privacy of Facebook users and infiltrate their lives.

	  Why hadn’t anyone thought to reassess the system that gave engineers access to user data? Zuckerberg asked. No one in the room pointed out that it was a system that he himself had designed and implemented. Over the years, his employees had suggested alternative ways of structuring data retention, to no avail. “At various times in Facebook’s history there were paths we could have taken, decisions we could have made, which would have limited, or even cut back on, the user data we were collecting,” said one longtime employee, who joined Facebook in 2008 and worked across various teams within the company. “But that was antithetical to Mark’s DNA. Even before we took those options to him, we knew it wasn’t a path he would choose.”

	  touted access as a selling point to new recruits on their engineering teams. Facebook was the world’s biggest testing lab, with a quarter of the planet’s population as its test subjects. The managers framed this access as part of Facebook’s radical transparency and trust in its engineering ranks.

	  Security was Sandberg’s responsibility, and Stamos technically fell under her purview. But she had never suggested, nor been consulted about, the sweeping changes he was proposing. Stamos prevailed that day, but he made several powerful enemies.

	  Users had flagged the Trump campaign account for hate speech in the past, and multiple strikes were grounds for removing the account entirely. Schrage, Bickert, and Kaplan, all Harvard Law grads, labored to conjure legal arguments that would justify the decision to allow the post. They were splitting hairs on what constituted hate speech, right down to Trump’s use of grammar.

	  The CEO was famously nervous in public appearances, prone to breaking into a sweat and stuttering through hard interviews. His staff rarely challenged him, so executives weren’t sure how he’d respond to tough questions, grandstanding, and interruptions—hallmarks of congressional hearings.

	  She quizzed him on the recommendations contained in Facebook’s own civil rights audit. He stuttered and took a big gulp from a plastic water bottle. When Zuckerberg said one recommendation was to form a task force that included Sandberg, Beatty scoffed. “We know Sheryl’s not really civil rights,” she said and chuckled dismissively, adding, “I don’t think there’s anything—and I know Sheryl well—about civil rights in her background.”
