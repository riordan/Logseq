	  Russian hackers are “like artists who wake up in the morning in a good mood and start painting,” Putin told a gaggle of reporters in June 2017, just three weeks before his hackers laid waste to Ukraine’s systems. “If they have patriotic leanings, they may try to add their contribution to the fight against those who speak badly about Russia.”

	  between 2016 and 2017 the gap between the United States’ cyber capabilities and those of every single other nation and bad-faith actor on earth closed substantially. Starting in 2016, the U.S. National Security Agency’s own cyber arsenal—the sole reason the United States maintained its offensive advantage in cyberspace—was dribbled out online by a mysterious group whose identity remains unknown to this day.

	  Russian trolls had been inundating Facebook pages frequented by young Ukrainian mothers with anti-vaccination propaganda. This, as the country reeled from the worst measles outbreak in modern history. Ukraine now had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the world and the Kremlin was capitalizing on the chaos. Ukraine’s outbreak was already spreading back to the States, where Russian trolls were now pushing anti-vaxxer memes on Americans. American officials seemed at a loss for how to contain it. (And they were no better prepared when, one year later, Russians seized on the pandemic to push conspiracy theories that Covid-19 was an American-made bioweapon, or a sinister plot by Bill Gates to profit off vaccines.)

As Goncharov tried to get Chernobyl’s networks back up, he got the call that the computers that monitored radiation levels—over the very same site of the blast more than three decades earlier—had gone dark. Nobody knew if the radiation levels were safe, or if they were being sabotaged in some sinister way.

	  There would be no phones, no internet. Oh, and no windows. That last bit proved particularly problematic. Italian architect Renzo Piano had designed the Times headquarters as a model of full transparency. The entire building—every floor, every conference room, every office—is encased in floor-to-ceiling glass, with the exception of one space: Arthur Sulzberger’s tiny storage closet. This last demand struck me as absurdly paranoid, but the Brits were insistent. There was the possibility that the National Security Agency, its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), or some foreign something somewhere would shoot laser beams at our windows and intercept our conversations. The same GCHQ technicians who looked on as the Guardian smashed Snowden’s hard drives had told them so.

	  I was to find out how far the world’s top intelligence agencies had come in cracking digital encryption. As it turned out, not very far. After several weeks of sorting through documents, it was becoming clear that the world’s digital encryption algorithms were—for the most part—holding up quite nicely. But it was also clear that the NSA didn’t need to crack those encryption algorithms when it had acquired so many ways to hack around them.

In one of the more glaring examples, a programming mistake, a single missing hyphen, sent the Mariner 1—the first American spacecraft to attempt an exploration of Venus—off-course, forcing NASA to destroy its $150 million spacecraft 294 seconds after launch, or risk it crashing into a North Atlantic shipping lane or worse, a heavily populated city. In our virtual world, the equivalent of the missing-hyphen error was everywhere, and now I was seeing just how critical to our nation’s premier spies they had become.

	  The NSA was searching for and honing its own zero-days inside the agency’s Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit. But as I pored through the Snowden documents, it also became apparent that many of these zero-days and exploits were sourced from outside the agency too. The documents hinted at a lively outsourcing trade with the NSA’s “commercial partners” and “security partners,” though it never named names or spelled those relationships out in detail.

The Brits conceded as much, and promised to retrieve them from Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian writer, who was now living in the jungles of Brazil. We only had a slice of the documents Snowden had stolen. Greenwald had the entire trove—including the two memos the Brits told us were critical to our encryption story—but apparently he was holding them hostage. Greenwald was no fan of the New York Times—to put it mildly—and Ewen and James told us he was furious the Guardian had brought the Times into the project.

Most people treated me like a child—the less I knew, they told me, the better. Also, as many, many men on Twitter regularly point out to me, nobody in cybersecurity actually uses “cyber” anymore. It’s “information security,” or preferably “infosec.” More than a few times, after introducing myself as a cybersecurity reporter at a hacking conference, I was told to GTFO. (Dear reader, I leave the deciphering of that code to you.) As it turns out, introducing yourself as “cyber” anything is the quickest way to the door.

	  James and Endler contemplated turning these bugs away. But they knew they needed to build trust, so that hackers would come back to them with bigger and better hauls. In those early days, the iDefense team swallowed their pride and shelled out for crud. The strategy worked, for a time. Among the first to start turning over serious zero-days was a hacker in Turkey by the name of Tamer Sahin. In 1999 Sahin had been arrested for hacking a Turkish web provider.

The bug netted Sahin $75—enough for a month’s rent in Turkey. Sahin became a one-man bug factory, turning over fifty bugs and exploits—enough to forgo a day job—for two years.

They wanted to see how far the bugs in their new internet toys could take them—which, as it turned out, was quite far. Hackers found they could tunnel through Microsoft’s systems to customers all over the web.

His favorite was a particularly stubborn zero-day exploit in a video memory card. The memory card ran on the computer’s firmware—the software closest to the bare metal of the machine—making the exploit nearly impossible to find and harder still to eradicate. Even if someone wiped the machine clean and restored all of its software, the video memory card exploit stuck. The only way for a target to be sure they had rid their systems of spies was to throw their computer in the dumpster. “That exploit was the best,”

And if he were any less humble, Gosler would probably concede as much. Instead, he credits his colleagues and bosses in the intel world and a host of New Age management gurus. Gosler frequently cites Malcolm Gladwell—“The Outlier is fantastic!” he told me, more than once. Gordon Moore and Andy Grove, two former chief executives of Intel, were his heroes. Grove’s book Only the Paranoid Survive is his bible. But his all-time favorite is Price Pritchett, the organizational management guru.

Very soon, he knew, they would not be able to guarantee the security of the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal. “You could still find vulnerabilities, sure, but your ability to guarantee no other vulnerabilities existed was becoming impossible.”

In a secure room at Fort Meade, the officials projected more than a dozen faces onto a bright screen. Each man on the screen, the analysts were told, was dead—thanks to their digital exploits. Half the men in the room felt an intense pride in knowing that their work had been used to kill terrorists. “The other half had an allergic reaction,” one former TAO analyst told me. “It was ‘Here’s your work. Here’s the death count. Good job. Keep up the great work.’ Until then, it was all about breaking an algorithm. It was about math. Suddenly it was about killing people. That’s when things changed.

The targets included lawyers for the women of Atenco—eleven students, activists, and market vendors who were arrested by police more than ten years ago during protests in the town of San Salvador Atenco, and brutally sexually assaulted on their way to prison. Aside from the grave abuse of power, the case was especially sensitive: the man who ordered the crackdown on the protesters was then governor, now president, Peña Nieto. In Mexico, only a federal judge can authorize the surveillance of private communications, and only when officials demonstrate a sound basis for the request. But it was highly unlikely a judge had approved the cases we were uncovering. Illegal surveillance in Mexico had become the norm, and now authorities could conduct click-and-shoot spying with NSO’s spyware. It didn’t matter what NSO’s contract did and did not allow. Once the company learns that its spyware has been abused—and by now, the most frequent tip-off its products were being abused was a call from yours truly—there is only so much it can do. NSO executives argued that they could not simply march into intelligence agencies, remove its hardware, and take back its tools.

	  But the analogy to Pearl Harbor is a deeply flawed one. America didn’t see that attack coming; we’ve seen the cyber equivalent coming for a decade. What we are experiencing instead is not one attack but a plague, invisible to the naked eye, that ripples across our country at an extraordinary rate, reaching ever deeper into our infrastructure, our democracy, our elections, our freedom, our privacy, and our psyche, with no end in sight. American computers are attacked every thirty-nine seconds. Only when there are highly visible mishaps do we pause for reflection. But the lessons from even the most destructive attacks tend to be forgotten too quickly. We have normalized them, even as the stakes grow higher, as the threats mutate into ever deadlier versions, as they hit us quicker than ever before. These unfolding crises play out in a dimension few of us can see, in a language few understand, and they are shutting down our cities, towns, and hospitals almost every other day.
