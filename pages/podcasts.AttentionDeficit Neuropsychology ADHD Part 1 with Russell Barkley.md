	  Increased mortality correlated with ADHD and accidental deaths
	  
	  Summary:
	  There's a really gutting mountain of research on this, papers with titles like attention deficit hyper activity disorder and mortality risk in tian. There was a nation wide cohort study out of denmark that found the mortality rate ratios were more than double for those with eight h d.

	  Is There a Disorder of Attention?
	  
	  Summary:
	  The first medical text book ever written in germany is dated 17 70. The author, melker weiker, describes what to day, we would think of as classic adult a d h d. Back then, they didn't know hit caused it. One of the recommendations for curing it was horseback riding and sour milk on top of some quinine. If that didn't work, lock you in a room.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeh? Well, we can go back nearly 250 years. People don't realize it, but i'm sitting here with an actual copy of the book, dated 17 70 in germany, in which a, this is the first medical text book ever written in german. It has a chapter called disorders of attention, if i don't believe that, and in it, the author, melker weiker, describes what to day, we would think of as classic adult a d h d. And back then, they didn't know hit caused it. They had a number of recommendations for curing it, one of which was horseback riding, sour milk on top of some quinine, and if that didn't work, lock you in a room. My god. So none of which works, but very interesting stuff none the less. But follow that forward, ok, nothing's written. About 15 years later, his student, alexander creyton, writes a text book. He also has a disorder of at attention chapter which he describes two attention disorders, one of which is e h d. And then things kind tof get buried for a while, until the late 18 hundreds, a fast forwrd, up to 19 hundred, george still publishes three papers of his lectures in which he describes these children. Then we have the 19 18 flew epidemic, in which we have a lot of kids developing eight h d who survive the flue. But we didn't really get into the what i consider the modern age of science until the ten

	  Brain Injured Child Centerm
	  
	  Summary:
	  Post and sephilitic behavior disorder was once called brain injured child centrum. Then it became minimal brain disfunction, m b d. Only in the 19 sixties did people say we w wed stop talking about causation because we really can't peer into the brain to see if there's damage there for most of these kids. And that's when it became hyperactive child sindrum.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, yet, we had children who, if they survived, this was the vanacanymos and sephalitis that swept through following the first world war, and it took over europe and then spread here, it left people with a lot of of secondary injuries to their brain, if they survive, because the virus attacked the brain. And it left children with altered personalities altered abilities, reducedmental capacity. But one of the hamark symptoms was hyperactive behavior, incorrigibility, lack of self control. So you had children's personalitys literally changing overnight, which the disorder actually backed them was called post and sephilitic behavior disorder. Then they eventually realized you could get it from other brain injuries, and it became brain injured child centrum. And then people said, well, wait, there are other children with these behavior problems, but we don't have evidence of brain injury. They then called it minimal brain damage, and then it became minimal brain disfunction, m b d. And only in the 19 sixties did people say, we w wed stop talking about causation, because we really can't peer into the brain to see if there's damage there for most of these kids. Let's just focus on their behavior. And that's when it became hyperactive child sindrum.

	  Causes of Adiot
	  
	  Summary:
	  About two thirds to three quarters of all a d cases fall on the realm genetics. The second is that about 25 to 35 % of the cases, particularly in boys more than girls, are acquired. And most of the acquired injuries are occurring during pregnancy.

	  Speaker 1
	  I've tried it oversimple because, let me tell you, it is so complicated that i have trouble keeping up with it. I mean, you really have to specialize in each of these areas, whether it's brain microstructure or white matter or, you know, nero imaging or functional connectivity. They're becoming almost specialties in themselves. But a, let me give you the grand picture, you know, from 30 thousand feet.

	  Speaker 2
	  get into it.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  You really have a two essential domains of causation here. One is amgenetic, and the other is neurological injury producing mal development. And i'll just very quickly, i'm going to over simplify. About two thirds to three quarters of all a d cases fall on the realm genetics. They are either inherited or they come about through what we call new or de novo mutations. I'll come back and explain that in a moment, because that's fascinating. But the second is that about 25 to 35 % of the cases, particularly in boys more than girls, are acquired. And most of the acquired injuries are occurring during pregnancy.

	  How Long Do You Wait to Have Children?
	  
	  Summary:
	  The longer you wait to have children, the more your gamates suffer mutations from just surviving. Males are more likely to have this and ways get passed along your child. The gens most likely to mutate under these circumstances are the gens for self regulation, language and sociability. So guess what goes up autism and a d hd?
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  So if i did a blood sample, i would not see these mutations. But if i sample your sperm, or if i look at your child, i will find the mutations in that baby. And you and your your spouse don't have them, unless i look at eggs and sperm. Now how is that happening? Because the longer you wait to have children, the more your gamates, as they're called, your eggs and sperm, are likely to suffer mutations from just surviving, from radiation, from chemicals, from external trama to male testes and things like that. You are racking up mutations. And if you wait a decade to have children, from age 20 to age 30, then you now have eight times more mutations in your eggs and sperm, but particularly in your sperm. Males are more likely to have this and ways get passed along your child. Now you say, we'll sell what? Well, it turns out that the gens most likely to mutate under these circumstances are the gens for self regulation, language and sociability. So guess what goes up autism and a d hd? The longer men and women wait to have children, those disorders begin to rise in frequency.

	  Imparmentor Symptoms
	  
	  Summary:
	  There's a lot more going on here than the surface features of inattention, distractability and maybe some hyper activity. There are seven major executive functions that come om largely your frontal lobe, but also interactions elsewhere in the brain. And they give us our capacity for self regulation. They take about 30 years to mature, and they're delayed in people with a d h d by several years or what? I'm glad you ask that, i because it's, there's Â a lot more going onto here than just those superficial symptoms. Could really get into the weeds, believe me.

So notice multiple causes all converging on a single network in the brain that is the brain's executive system that gives us self regulation. And for various reasons it goes wrong. Can

	  you go through perhaps a few of the most noteworthy imparmentor symptoms? Cause i knowhat probably a lot of us feel like ar, my focusis fractured, or i can't put down my phone, rites it's difficult to porse out. Well,

	  you know, i'm glad you ask that, i because it's, there's a lot more going on here than the surface features of inattention, distractability, of impulsiveness and maybe some hyper activity, though that's really an early childhood symptom more than it is an adult symptom. Ah, but that's said to me that'. That's the superficial nature of a d h d that everybody sees. Now, let's look under the hood. What's going wrong under the hood in the mind that is leading to you to behave that way? And that's where we get into the executive functions.

The fact is, these abilities that everybody else is getting, you're not getting. What are they? The seven? N one, inhibition, self restraint. Number two, self awareness, the ability to monitor and attend to your own behavior. Both of these start very early in life. Each takes at least ten years to mature, if not more. Ah, and then when those start to kick off, you get the next two, which has to do with working memory. And the first one is non verbal working memory, but you know it as visual imagery, which is a capacity to imagine things. You recall images in your mind from your past. Call it hindsight, and you use those to anticipate what could happen next. Foresight. The fourth thing you're going to get is the mind's voice. You're going to start to develop language to yourself. It's all out loud. Little children talk out loud to themselves. But by the time you're eight to ten, that should be in your head. You should be able to talk to yourself without people hearing you, and without you moving your lips in your fa and so now you've got four executive abilities.

And then finally, you get the biggy, the last one, which is planning and problem solving, the ability to manipulate h stuff in your head to come up with solutions to get around obstacles and help you get to your goals and solve your problems.

	  Speaker 2
	  not fun. Those
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  are the seven deficits that people with a d h d have to varying degrees. How would you recognize that? You would see that? Because number one, they are very impulsive and show very poor self control and self regulation. Two, they are not as aware of their difficulties as are the people around them, because they are not self monitoring to the extent that you do. Three, they are horrible at time management. Because the working memory system, in part, gives you your sense of time and timing, and allows you to think about the future, to deliberate what is coming next, and then to use that to inform your own be vior. So time management becomes a major deficit that just gets worse and worse with age, because life becomes more time sensitive with age. Three year olds don't have to manage time.

Because number one, they are very impulsive and show very poor self control and self regulation. Two, they are not as aware of their difficulties as are the people around them, because they are not self monitoring to the extent that you do. Three, they are horrible at time management. Because the working memory system, in part, gives you your sense of time and timing, and allows you to think about the future, to deliberate what is coming next, and then to use that to inform your own be vior. So time management becomes a major deficit that just gets worse and worse with age, because life becomes more time sensitive with age.

	  You can have a lot of trouble with self motivation. You're going to procrastinate. Anything that does have an immediate pay off is very hard for you to stay with. And you'll keep being distracted by anything that offers you a promise of immediate gratification. And then when you're faced with problems, instead of sticking it out and trying to problem solve, people with a d h d tendequin, they tend to simply shift over and go to something else. And so they have a life that's, you know, filled with half completed projects and goals never reach and accomplishments everybody else is able to do and they can't do, or they struggle to do. And so it really gets very demoralizing by the time you're a ten ager or an adult, because all these problems are piling on year after year. As other people get each of those executive abilities, you get another deficit. So by adulthood, you have at least seven or more problems with self regulation that other people don't have. And it leads to a whole swath of down stream problems in major life activities that people just don't realize. A dhe's one of the most impairing disorders we treat in an adult out patient basis. And and people think it's just some trivial little problem that a cup of star bux is ento solve.

	  now let's talk about, as my husband calls it, his friend, dope a, dopemin. He's constantly wrangling with dope a. What is the role of dopemin in eight h d? Well,
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  we used to think it explained everything, and now we know that things are a lot more complicated. But back in the day, when i came in, in the seventies and eighties, the guessing was that a d h had to be due to dopomine deficiency, because the drugs we've discovered to manage it all produced increases in dopemine availability in the brain. And they did it through various mechanisms. They don't all do the same but at the end of the day, the net result is that there's more dopamine in the brain to do the job that it's not doing in people with a d h. D and it turned out that, while that is true, we also began o iscover that norapen efron, which is related to dopemine, also is implicated in the disorder. Hence, you have eli lily coming out with stratera, which is honora penefron, a drug thatin ses noropenefen in the brain. Then you have the new calbry that came out just thi past april. And that's a new drugah, that's a norpenefen drug. But then we also began to realize, now, wait a second. There's other things going on on the brain here.

We can get at a d h d through at least three, and probably more, neuro transmitters. And then managing the alpha tue ports and the noise in the frontal lobe is what anti hypertensive drugs are doing.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Well,
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  we used to think it explained everything, and now we know that things are a lot more complicated. But back in the day, when i came in, in the seventies and eighties, the guessing was that a d h had to be due to dopomine deficiency, because the drugs we've discovered to manage it all produced increases in dopemine availability in the brain.

And that's a new drugah, that's a norpenefen drug. But then we also began to realize, now, wait a second. There's other things going on on the brain here. Im we're discovering that these alpha two ports, as they're called, in the frontal lobe, which are little, i'll call them sphincters. A sphincter says what, but holes on nerons in the frontal lobe that open and close to determine how much noise is in the nerve cell. That these alpha to ports, which are responsive to alpitude drugs, also are beneficial for a d h d because they fine tune the nerve signals in the executive brain. So we can get at a d h d now through at least three, and probably more, neuro transmitters, dopamine being one, and that's what the stimulants are doing, norp and efon being the other, and that's what the non stimulants are doing. And then managing the alpha tue ports and the noise in the frontal lobe, and that's what the anti hypertensive drugs are doing, clanadine and quanfacine.

	  Can Stimulants Really Treat Anxiety?

	  Speaker 2
	  Yes, i will definitely tell him. And you know, when it comes to creating the architecture of a treatment plan, whether it's medication, or rather deciding medication, how does some one go about figuring out which of those three types of medication, from stimulant to non stimulant to maybe even hypertension drugs? Am, do you recommend? Trial and error? So
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  at this point, besides clinical trial and error as well as clinician preference, let's understand some clinitions. Prefer they're more comfortable with working with certain drugs and other drugs. Ah, we know in research that we can create literally a check list of different issues that one might want to contemplate in choosing a medication. You know, one would be urgency. How fast do i get get control over your problem, because you are experiencing a lot of suffering? Well, the stimulants would be the choice because they work much, much faster than the non stimulants do. Ok. But on the other hand, you have an anxiety disorder? U, yes, i thing i do. Well, hold on a second. We know that in a subset of people, stimulants can make anxiety worse. That's arguable. It doesn't happen in everybody, it happens enough that clinitians get a little concerned about that. And that's where we might want to go with a non stimulant, like a stratera or a kelbry, because that actually treats anxiety in the context of a d h d as well. Well. Then we might also have somebody who's showing very high levels of hyper active, aggressive and just sort of over arouse behavior.

So she has a diagram of what it's like to have a conversation with her. And the diagram for the typical person is a, i started a, and i want to explain this, and i get to b, and it's a straight line. Hers looks like a maze of all over the place, getting dis acted, talking about irrelevant things. Can't remember what we were describing. Have to ask you what we were talking about, you know.

	  If
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  you look at that book, compared to all my other books, it's organized vastly differently than my other books. And the reason is we've field tested the manuscript on adults with a d h d. And and that's why you see thati it's all broken up. There's little side bars nd theres glibzy little microscopes, and there's call outs and bold emphasis. And, you know, it's enough to drive a typical person crazy when they look at this thing. How do you pay attention to this? Cause they're used to reading like continuous prose and narrative, and this is so far from that, as you know. So that was field test, and we found that, at least, if you're going to read, that captured your attention better than typical narrative does. Well done. The second thing that we do, of course, is a lot of adults tell me that the e book is better for them than that. I also get, you know, five to ten e mials a day of people in. I discovered you through your youtube lectures, and that's the first time i was actually able to sit through and listen to this stuff. So maybe now i'll goand get the e book or look at some of your podcasts that you've done, you know, with other people like you, and start to pick it up that way. And then eventually they wind up back at the book. But we understand that reading is very hard for adults with a d hd because of their working memory problems. They can't retain what they read the way other people can, and they find themselves mind wandering while they're reading. And then they got to go back to the top of the page seven times. So, you know, i understand. I get it that text isn't always the best way for adults with a d hd to learn stuff. I
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  was looking through the book, and i was so excited to see, like others, a poste note and a side bar. And it really does kind of engage it. And i've even heard, you know, leave post and notes for yourself, have and be different colors, something now engages you and is novel. Will will help. And obviously, we got a lot of questions from from listeners ahead of time, literally

	  Anxiety Disorders Are Not That Hard
	  
	  Summary:
	  A d h d, people are not in their head that much. And if they are, it's because their ideas are skipping all over the place. They're going to be inattentive in a staring, day dreaming, mind wandering kind of way like an absent minded professor. By the time you're in your thirties, 35 to 50 % of adults with a d h d have developed an anxiety disorder. But that's because of the chronic failure that a d hd is leading to.

	  So they're inattentive, but they're going to be inattentive in a staring, day dreaming, mind wandering kind of way, like an absent minded professor. They're not hyperactive. They're not distracted. They're just in their head, wag too. And a d h d, people are not in their head that much, and if they are, it's because their ideas are skipping all over the place. So the two disorders are not that hard. I mean, a d h d does not lead to fear, worry, anxiety, initially. Now, after about ten to 20 years of not being treated, anxiety disorders begin to become a co existing disorder with a d h d, such that by the time you're in your thirties, 35 to 50 % of adults with a d h d have developed an anxiety disorder. But that's because of the chronic failure that a d h d is leading to. So, you know, you don't have to fail in social situations or at work too many times before you get really anxious in those environments. But that's a different kind of anxiety that mes from over exposure to negative consequences, and even dramatic consequences that other people don't experience. On the other hand, if you have a legitimate anxiety disorder, yours is much more forward looking. You are over anticipating punishment, negative consequences, what people think about you.

And it's four o'clock, so the kid's been out of school an hour. Is he sitting at a curb with his teacher because i'm not there? And he freaks out. So, you see it.

	  Or couch. Sleep is couch. Whatever is good is good for you. So that by way of saying that, you know, a lot of times we have to address that sleep problem through other means, whether it's through another medication, whether it's through switching you away from a stimulant, because stimulants cause insomnia, where as the non stimulants don't, maybe we have to send you to a sleep lab for a 24 hour, you know, a polysomnogram, where we look at your rhythm day and night, but particularly during sleep, to see if it's inefficient. A we know that about, you know, ten % of the people with sleep problems, it's due to obstructed airways. Totonselectimes are indicated and resultan significant improvement in in children and possibly adults. But it's more o the researches on kids. So if you're snoring a lot, if you have sleep apnea, then we want to look at, how do we expand that air way, surgically or otherwise? And you can find that that improve sleep, and then the kids are better the next day. So there's a lot going on around the sleep thing that i don't want to over simplify. And it isn't just procrastination. There really is a diurnal rhythm problem here with alertness. Now that's said, procrastination is probably the number one problem that adults with a d h d report as part of their attention deficits. So, ok, sighed. We did touch on this and the tonal psychology episode. And doctor joseph rary, leading expert in the world on procrastination, said this,
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  i hesitate to say this because sometimes you will get very annoyed with my comet, but there's only been one study there looked at procrastination in a d h d. And i did it, and i found practically no relationship, really.

	  Do people with dh d show a heightened emotional reaction in these situations?
	  
	  Summary:
	  The et h d effect on marriage, by milissa orlov is a book you may want to get yesterday if you're not married. Jerry and i wouldn't be married if we hadn't both listened to that book in 20 17. I think it changed our relationship so fundamentally. Does your partner have ath d? Or do you the book?

	  On
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  the other hand, do people with dh d show a heightened emotional reaction in these situations? The answer is yesbut but we know where that comes from. One of the executive functions is emotional self regulation. And we know that a d h individuals can't do that as well as other people. And therefore, when they are faced with environmental situations that are frustrating, impatient, non ording or even aggressive toward them, or where they sense rejection from another person, they're going to react emotionally much more than other people do. But it's not just two social relationships. It is across the board. They're going to be more emotional even when they're alone. And in counter frustration. I mean, i had a weight lifter tell me that he tore the door off of his car because when he parked it, went into the parking lot, he left the keys in and he locked the door. Now this is back old school days, where these days, very hard to do that, because cars are programmed to do that. But this guy literally spent 30 minutes by the side of the road in a parking lot tearing the door off a car, that's how angry he got. Road rage is characteristic of forty to 55 % of adults with a d h d. All it takes as another driver to cut you off aggressively, and you engage. And so the emotion of ad h permeates almost everything. It explains why there is a lot more intimate partner aggressiveness and frustration a in intimate partner relationships, because they can be some of the most challenging and frustrating and emotional situations that we have. Does your partner have ath d? Or do you the book? The et h d effect on marriage, by milissa orlov is a book you may want to get yesterday

	  if you're not married.

	  Speaker 1
	  Worst thing about my job right now is i'm 72, and i see the end of my career ahead of me. And im you know, it's been a great ride. I just can't tell you how rewarding it has been to work in this field. It's why i wrote the four books during the pandemic, the one for parents, the 12 principals book. I basically sat down and said, if you could reduce over a half million research studies, papers, conferences to crucial ideas that we've learned that everybody needs to know, it would be those 12 andhe the adult taking charge has the same information, i just didn't phrase it that way. Ah, so, you know, the bad thing for me is i i can see this coming, and i'm stepping back, and i'm moving into semi retirement and enjoying my grandchildren. Ah, but i'm going to miss the right. It's been extremely rewarding to be this helpful to so many people through the act of scientific discovery. And more importantly, as karl sagan and others have shown, is to disseminate it, leave the
