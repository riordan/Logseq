But actually 120 other ships containing 1200 flex port containers were stuck behind that ship or ahead of it depends which way they're going. Uh and also couldn't be delivered and how to get delayed. And that's the biggest cost that's gonna come about through litigation and everything else that flows through here is all of these people feel like, hey, you owe me money, you blocked my delivery and all of that. That's gonna be a lot of lawsuits. It's not just the cost of the rescue operation, the dredging of the canal and everything else. It's like all these people who had their cargo delayed and what's the, how do you quantify that? It's like, is it the

	  Speaker 2: I don't know if there's like client confidentiality, but can you tell us some of the items that are stuck on the what types of items are stuck on that boat? 
	  
	  Speaker 0: Yeah, there is a lot of confidentiality but I know that one of our customers has um is a relatively famous company that make and I can't show that I make keyboard, keyboards and mice entire like many container loads of that. By the way of the 43 containers, we have all of the customers except for three opted into cargo insurance, which will cover the damages in the eventual lawsuits that come out of this. Those three we're gonna have to work through and make sure it doesn't bankrupt them. But one of the little known facts

	  Speaker 0: global shipping is under ancient maritime law. The company shipping the cargo, not the owner of the ship, but the company that whose cargo owns the cargo. The products on there is liable when something like this happens. Yeah. And and the reason that's a law called General Average. It's a fascinating Wikipedia article. And the reason that that's true under ancient sort of not, I mean ancient. Yeah, it goes back. I think hundreds of years. The reason that that was true is that in the in a storm or an accident at sea, you don't want people to stop and argue about whose cargo they're going to throw overboard. And do you want the mariner? You don't want these arguments, You don't

You don't want these arguments, You don't want the Mariners like worrying about that. Just throw the cargo over and save the ship is the principal. And you'll sort it out later. And the way you sort it out later is everybody agrees that we will share equally in whoever's cargo got thrown over, the rest of the people will make them whole. And that's a principle called General average.

And that's a principle called General average. And the ocean carrier under the law has the right to invoke general average and declare it and say, okay. And so that's what evergreen has done. They have declared general Average, which means all of the customers who have cargo on that ship are going to be liable for the damages that come through. Um And it could be billions of dollars in aggregate. And it and it gets divided pro rata based on the commercial invoice value of your goods. And

	  Speaker 1: Someone needs to fix this. 
	  
	  Speaker 0: Um, that's all of us as a logistics industry, that it's really tough. The analogy I've been using with my teams that were doing wedding planning outdoors and all of a sudden we've been moved to Seattle, you know, and it's like, well every you better be warning your customers about what's going on, tell them that hey, we're not able to. 30% of ships are being, are not making their schedule right now, 37% of containers are getting rolled, which is like what it calls when you get bumped in an airline, when you get, when you get bumped to the next plane. That's kind of getting rolled in. Ocean container shipping, 37%. Industry standard industry average before the pandemic was 8%. So it's just like a huge spike in in fairly service

So it's just like a huge spike in in fairly service delivery failure and it's a ton of second order effects because right, when, when that and this was the Ever Given is a really good example like that ship. Okay, it's six days late. The ships behind it were six days late. I mean they ever get is gonna be months late, but the ones behind it were six days late arriving. But now they were supposed to go to the next port and the next port, they're gonna be delayed there and there and all those other bookings that were supposed to get put on, get rolled and have to find a new, you know, what ship do they go on? It's a mad scramble that was just like adding insult to injury after a year of this. Well of

	  Speaker 0: big brand last two weeks ago and it's taken them 300 days when they place the purchase order with their factory 300 days before it's ready to get picked up. Which normally this is like a 30 day process. So you've got delays at the factory ships, there wasn't enough capacity. Well, we also ran out of containers And this is a really interesting second order effect, imports have surged us, exports are down like 20% of containers. If you don't have containers being exported, You don't have empty containers up to put those imports in coming back and it needs to run in a loop. So normal days, pre pandemic, 60% of us of containers leaving the United States are empty. Uh it's it's running around 80% right now. But for a

	  Speaker 0: But for a while they didn't the ocean carriers weren't on top of this and just shipping back extra empties to make sure that they have enough capacity. So there was a moment a couple of months ago where we were as a as an industry as a society. 500,000 shipping containers short in China. 
	  
	  Speaker 2: Sorry sorry, could you just explain that? Why is the shipment back of empty containers a problem 
	  
	  Speaker 0: because normally you have your full stuff going? Yeah but U. S. Exports fell off a cliff right and nobody thought hey I still need the container even if I'm not exporting the goods. 
	  
	  Speaker 2: So the ships were going back to china but leaving empty containers 
	  
	  Speaker 0: and the empties were staying here because they would get imported and usually they get exported automatically. And that's like a
