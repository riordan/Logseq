	  This objective requires careful observation and a specific type of interview: we need to prompt customers to walk through a given process/workflow step-by-step so that we can study what happens. I flesh out a complete interview guide, but a few core questions serve as my North Star. I get pretty detailed with each step of their process, asking the participants, “What’s your goal right now? How does it start? Then what? And then what? Can you show me?”

	  During interviews, those North Star Questions help me focus on gathering the information I need most, and keep me from getting lost in the weeds, especially when talking to experts about an unfamiliar or fairly technical domain.

	  Our final step will be to put this information together in a way that makes sense to the client. In this case, I usually use a spreadsheet. Down the first column on the left, I label rows with the key details I want to capture for every step, such as: name of the step, who’s involved, their goals, what they do, questions they’re trying to answer, and pain points (or opportunities!). Then I fill out all of the fields for each step, fleshing out the columns from left to right.
