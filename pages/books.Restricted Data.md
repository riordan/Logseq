	  Turning this desire for control into action is where the scientists repeatedly stumbled. It is one thing to say that you don’t want the Nazis to know something, but how do you make it so? The practice of self-censorship was a weak one, because they could not enforce it effectively: there were no consequences for breaking it. Weak practices, coupled with relatively weak institutions (like scientific journals, which have no strong powers to regulate people), resulted in a non-functional secrecy regime, or at least one that was easily cracked. Only once they got serious about the institutionalization of secrecy did it begin to function, and that involved bringing in the big guns, literally. Government agencies, partnering with the military, and applying mindsets very different than those the scientists were accustomed to working with, would add “teeth” to this secrecy, at the cost of the autonomy of the scientists.

	  Practices were being put into place, one by one: document control (“SECRET” stamps), obfuscation (code-names), misinformation (to the press), compartmentalization (“need to know” policies), personnel discrimination (clearances and background checks), site-isolation (secret laboratories), physical security (barbed wire and guards), publication censorship (initially voluntary, later not), and oaths of secrecy (both psychological and legal in their intent) had all come into place. None of the individual elements were unique to the bomb, though in other OSRD programs, they had been implemented with less fanfare.

	  But at the heart of the matter, it was a cumulative series of half-steps that led to the secrecy of the Manhattan Project, and practically every policy embraced, and amplified, by the military had already been put in place by civilian scientists before they arrived, inspired by their fears.

	  They were trying to keep the secret not merely from the Axis powers, but also from all US allies except the United Kingdom, as well as the national and international presses, the American Congress, and, to various degrees, nearly everyone who was working on the project itself, whose “need to know” extended only as far as necessary to do their direct jobs. Even maintaining such a secret for a relatively short amount of time—under three years—was a gargantuan task.

	  Though it would be celebrated as “the best-kept secret of war,” this mandate was in fact impossible: the effort to make the atomic bomb, on the time-scale required, meant that “absolute secrecy” could never be achieved in practice.

	  At its helm would be a notoriously gruff, undiplomatic, and relentless Army Colonel who had helped Marshall organize the early work: Leslie R. Groves. Of all the figures responsible for the successful wartime development of the atomic bomb, none perhaps can take as much credit as Groves. An engineer by training, he was not enthusiastic about taking on the assignment, as its chances of success were hardly guaranteed, and it was far from the front lines. But once he accepted the job, he was going to push it to completion. For the next three years, he dedicated every ounce of his will toward making the atomic bomb a reality in time for it to play some role in the war. His only precondition was that he be promoted to brigadier general first in order to better enforce his orders, especially with the “many academic scientists involved in the project,” who he thought would be reluctant to take orders from a mere colonel.

	  He charted out a program to scale up the project by securing uranium stocks and obtaining a top military priority rating that would allow him to push his project even in the face of opposition from other Army generals as he began to siphon off scarce resources, human and material, into a project whose goals were known to only a select few.4

	  Groves made it clear that to him, not only was compartmentalization key to secrecy, but also it was a tool to control scientific personnel: Compartmentalization of knowledge, to me, was the very heart of security. My rule was simple and not capable of misinterpretation—each man should know everything he needed to know to do his job and nothing else. Adherence to this rule not only provided an adequate measure of security, but it greatly improved over-all efficiency by making our people stick to their knitting. And it made quite clear to all concerned that the project existed to produce a specific end product—not to enable individuals to satisfy their curiosity and to increase their scientific knowledge.12

	  At each of the major project sites, compartmentalization operated somewhat differently, because of the different character of the work done at each location. At industrial production sites, like Oak Ridge and Hanford, almost all of the labor force was kept entirely ignorant of the goals of their work. This affected morale, and manpower retention, in a severe way. The civilians who worked at Oak Ridge and Hanford were not doing so under duress; they could leave and do other war work if they wanted to. The rate of labor turn-over at Hanford, where living conditions were poor, was 20%. At Oak Ridge, it was 17%. Thus, even when the project’s overall labor force was growing by tens of thousands of new employees each month, it was also having to make up losses of thousands per month as well.

	  One postwar report at Oak Ridge closely linked the problems of secrecy and the problems of morale: The war worker in Oak Ridge, Tennessee has been working under some of the most unique working conditions ever known. Due to the secrecy surrounding the nature of the Project, he never saw the results of this labor. There was nothing in which he could take pride. Thus, one of the common incentives for work was not present. No sense of satisfaction could be realized in a job well done. Naturally, this created quite a problem of morale not commonly experienced.14

	  Lastly, the white badge indicated people allowed to know the full scope of what they were doing at Los Alamos, though their access to specific technical information would be decided by their own division and group leaders. For those with white badges, Los Alamos could be relatively free, if they could make a case for their “need to know”: scientists had authority to choose what could be talked about, and to whom, once they were within that category.19

	  Oppenheimer also secured permission from an extremely reluctant Groves to have a laboratory-wide weekly colloquia series where anyone with a white badge could attend to discuss specific scientific problems relating to the project’s goals. This sort of activity apparently did not take place at other scientific laboratories associated with the bomb work (like Berkeley or Chicago), and this made Los Alamos a special place, befitting, perhaps, its isolated status.

	  Scientists who challenged this tight control were at risk. None did this more than Leo Szilard, prompting Groves to draw up papers for his internment for the duration of the war; fortunately for Szilard, these were rejected by the secretary of war.29

	  How far would Groves and his counterintelligence agents go to stem threats? Would they have gone further than incarceration? There are rumors, perhaps impossible to confirm, that they might have been willing to take extreme measures in some cases. Jean Tatlock, a former girlfriend of Oppenheimer, died under suspicious circumstances during the war. Tatlock was considered by the security forces to be a Communist or Communist-sympathizer, and in the summer of 1943, Oppenheimer was surveilled as he spent the night at her apartment in San Francisco. In January 1944, Tatlock was found in her apartment by her father, “lying on a pile of pillows at the end of the bathtub, with her head submerged in the partly filled tub.” The cause of death was asphyxiation by drowning, and barbiturates and chloral hydrate (the active ingredient of “Mickey Finn” knockout drops) were found in her system. A suicide note in a shaky hand was present at the scene. Did she die by her own hand, or was it something else? It sounds too cloak and dagger to be true, but later revelations about “active measures” taken by American security forces during World War II and the Cold War make it hard to completely dismiss the idea that Tatlock may have been seen as a security risk too dangerous to tolerate.

	  In his memoirs, Groves went to great pains to emphasize that for him, the “speed of the accomplishment was paramount”: [S]ecurity was not the primary object of the Manhattan Project. Our mission was to develop an atomic bomb of such power that it would bring the war to an end at the earliest possible date. Security was an essential element, but not all-controlling. . . . All procedures and decisions on security, including the clearance of personnel, had to be based on what was believed to be the overriding consideration—completion of the bomb.34

	  The number of actual spies in the Manhattan Project was quite finite—at most around a dozen, out of a project that had well over 10,000 technical workers and hundreds of thousands of non-technical workers—but important.41 Almost all of the ones who had access to secrets directly were “moles,” scientists or engineers who had volunteered their services to the Soviets, as opposed to trained Soviet agents.

	  In one of his final meetings with President Roosevelt, in December 1944, Groves had explained that “there was every evidence the Russians were continuing to spy on our work, particularly at Berkeley.” This was not taken as any great scandal: its chief import was as to whether the Soviet Union should be “brought in” on the secret. Groves ultimately rejected this option, believing “that it was essential not to take them into our confidence until we were sure to get a real quid pro quo from our frankness.”42 Secrets, in this framing, were things to be bartered away at a later date.

	  Atomic energy had been a big story in the early 1940s; it would not vanish completely just because scientific publications on the matter had stopped. In fact, the lack of scientific publications could itself be suspicious. Time magazine noted that scientific meetings in May 1942 were under-attended and exceptionally vague, and that “exploration of the atom—chief interest of physicists—has come to a stop”: Such facts as these add up to the biggest scientific news of 1942: that there is less and less scientific news. . . . . A year ago one out of four physicists was working on military problems; today, nearly three out of four.

	  The problem, though, was that the “reasons for secrecy” were themselves a secret. In such a situation, even the military itself could be a source of leaks, since most of its members were also being kept out of the loop.

	  The fact that these news stories, along with the sudden drop in fission research publications, were apparently not pieced together by the Axis powers into a coherent understanding that the Manhattan Project existed might be taken as either a success of the Manhattan Project security agents or a failure of Axis intelligence agencies. But it should be noted that the trend here is easier to see in retrospect. Each of these articles also contained significant errors, and the information environment regarding the work on secret weapons in World War II was messy. If one wasn’t looking closely, this could all be just part of the background noise of war.

	  The Truman Committee would again have to be dissuaded from probing, having sent an “ugly letter” to the War Department (in Stimson’s reading of it). Stimson reminded him of his previous agreement to leave it alone. Truman was also told by the undersecretary of war that “it is the most important and most secret project that we have.” In his diary, Stimson recorded that Truman “threatened me with dire consequences. I told him I had been directed by the President to do just what I did. Truman is a nuisance and a pretty untrustworthy man. He talks smoothly but he acts meanly.”101

	  In early March 1945, Groves made an account of the total number of congressmen who had been officially informed about the bomb: seven. He felt that perhaps they ought to take a small delegation of senators and representatives to visit the sites at Hanford and Oak Ridge, so they could see that the worst rumors about waste or misspending were unfounded. Los Alamos was completely off limits. This visit would be desirable, he noted to Stimson, “from the security standpoint alone, as well as from the standpoint of minimizing the Congressional investigation with which we will be faced after the war.”111

	  when the War Department did seek out congressmen to let them “in on the secret,” they got strong support. Sociologists of secrecy have long noted that the ritualistic aspects of being “let in” on a secret can reinforce loyalty—the oaths, hushed ceremony, and grave warnings—seemingly heighten a sense of tribal belonging and encourage complicity, and this may be part of the story.113

	  For Groves, Stimson, Bush, and even Roosevelt, the importance of the bomb trumped the usual demands for transparent democratic institutions. It is this legacy that is perhaps the most chilling aspect of the Manhattan Project. Yet it is this aspect which, in the postwar period, was the least examined: Congress was willing to accept that it had to be left out of the loop, and that security might necessitate a reduction in accountability.115

	  As the project went on, many Chicago scientists migrated to other wartime sites, but many were kept at the Met Lab in a sort of scientific holding pen, where they would still be under the constraints of security but their access to weapons work was limited. The result was that many of these scientists, well acquainted with the bomb program but unable to further contribute to it technically, began thinking seriously about what would come next.

	  Smyth saw the bomb as coming directly from basic and fundamental research, and thus reasoned that in order to stay ahead, the United States would have to further invest in more basic research. That the Manhattan Project approach could not continue into the postwar period he considered obvious, as its monopolization of university scientists would make the training of new scientists impossible, and no good research scientists would want to join up with such a practically-minded, government-run entity.

	  Furthermore, if Manhattan Project papers could be downgraded in classification to “Restricted” or “Confidential” (which have far fewer restrictions than “Secret,” much less “Top Secret”) it would allow wider circulation during the “transition” period that would inevitably occur after the wartime regime ended.121 As will be clear in the next chapter, Smyth’s shift toward a demarcating approach likely owes much to the fact that he had been recently engaged in trying to make exactly these sorts of judgments for his technical history of the project; it is one thing to imagine eliminating secrecy in the abstract, it is another to actually try to apply these principles to something concrete.

	  In an “Informal Memorandum” on postwar atomic policies in March 1944, Shurcliff argued that maintaining secrecy over the long term would probably be called for, though some leakage was inevitable (it would be “almost irresistible” for people “in the know” to reveal it at some point), and that no doubt confusion would be caused when scientists “rediscovered” classified principles: “Rediscoverers” located in [the] USA may be expected to tender their “discoveries” to the government and to feel puzzled and even resentful if the government expresses no interest or places the entire matter under secrecy and then expresses no interest. By repeatedly pestering the government (and perhaps press and congressmen also) with ideas already well known to the government and perhaps already in use by it, the rediscoverers will soon be able to make a fair estimate of the secret project.124

	  The predominant scientists’ view would have required a total commitment and total confidence: if secrets did matter, then releasing them would be disastrous, for they could not be “recalled” once let out. If secrets were of marginal importance to domestic development, the only detriment would be slowed American innovation, but, as Shurcliff pointed out, this was significant only if you believed that a more primitive atomic bomb could be made irrelevant by a more sophisticated one. The positions of the scientists against secrecy were probably purposefully extreme, though, in anticipation that the “conservative” position would likely be the default, and their appeals to the importance of openness as a scientific norm were also blatant appeals for a restoration of their own lost autonomy.

	  Both Stimson and Groves had brought reports for Truman to read.138 Stimson’s was to the point: within a few months, the United States will likely have “the most terrible weapon ever known in human history, one bomb of which could destroy a whole city,” but once used, it would only be a matter of time until other nations acquired their own. Long-term thinking would need to be applied to avoid the destruction of civilization.139

	  After specifying the “external” threats, Groves then turned to the “internal.” Compartmentalization, he explained to his son, could be used “to keep members of the project working on their own tasks, rather than thinking and worrying about the tasks of others.” Again, this was an organizational use of secrecy practices, as a form of labor practice, reflecting, no doubt, Groves’ particular disdain for the unruly academics. If you didn’t keep such scientists on track, they would end up treating the project as “an advanced post-doctorate university.”

Classified “cover sheets” would become a staple of the US national security state, indicating at a glance to anyone who came into contact with them that they were entering into the province of secrets. The “Top Secret” cover sheets used by Groves featured an elaborate hand-lettering more reminiscent of a teenager’s binder than national security secrets.

	  it is interesting to note to whom the Smyth Report gives the lion’s share of credit for making the atomic bomb: the physicists and physics as a discipline. As the historian Rebecca Press Schwartz has argued, Smyth’s focus on physics likely had multiple origins.16 Smyth was himself a physicist, and clearly did see the physical nature of the atomic bomb as what distinguished it from all other past weapons. Without nuclear fission, there would be no bomb. But this focus also obscured the contributions of chemists, metallurgists, and engineers to the project. Complex scientific-industrial processes such as the atomic bomb involve a multitude of experts of all sorts, and within the Manhattan Project the organizational charts reflected an awareness that physics was hardly king, even though many of the top scientist-administrators were indeed physicists.

The Smyth Report was still the one part of this strategy that had not yet been finalized, since Stimson had wanted it cleared by the President himself. Groves again felt the need to underscore the importance of the Smyth Report: “In my opinion, it is essential that this release be made promptly if we are to have any hope of success in our efforts to retain the maximum amount of secrecy on our work.”

	  It is worth reemphasizing how radical the positions of Bohr, Bush, and Conant were regarding international control, and how impressive it is that they managed to get any traction at all in high levels of government. The argument was that a new technology—the atomic bomb—would require a remaking of the world. International politics and industrial practices would both have to be forever changed. The Soviet Union would have to open up to inspection, or else. Their imaginations included wars that could end civilization as it was known, and they worried that secrecy might turn these fears into realities. But making practical policy on this matter would prove difficult. In the postwar period, Bush would write to Truman directly on the matter, emphasizing the starkness of their options. There were only “two paths”: “international collaboration” or a “secret arms race on atomic energy,” the latter of which could lead to “a very unhappy world.”

The commission was granted total supervision and direction “over all matters connected with atomic research, the production of atomic fission, and the release of nuclear energy,” limited only by the jurisdiction of the United States. It would claim custody of all ores of fissionable material and all means by which fissional material could be produced and allowed the President to appropriate any property he deemed “necessary and proper for the use of the Commission” through eminent domain and condemnation, including patents. The commission would be allowed to fund related research and grant licenses for research by nongovernmental entities (contractors), and the act would make it “unlawful for any person to conduct atomic research or experimentation concerning the release of nuclear energy, without the consent, and subject to the direction and supervision” of the commission. The commission was also authorized to develop and administer security regulations “governing the collection, dissemination, publication, transmission, and communication of all information, data, documents, equipment and material of any kind relating to or connected with atomic research and the release of nuclear energy.”

	  In Bush’s mind, the commission should be like a combination of the Food and Drug Administration and the OSRD, not a military hegemon. Congress, he felt, would not grant such “sweeping and unrestricted powers.” As for the broad power the bill granted the commission to control all information on “atomic research,” Bush considered that it “undoubtedly goes too far at the present time and would be unenforceable.” The commission should “certainly” control information created at its own plants and in work that it has contracted for, and over information “relating directly to the embodiment of results in military devices,” but beyond that, Bush was unsure. The long-term question of secrecy in nuclear science still vexed him, and he was “quite sure that any attempt to control as generally as this section would indicate would be quite futile.”

	  For Groves, the key was not controlling information—that could leak out or be stolen by spies. Instead, he wanted to control the uranium. Without access to large stores of uranium, there would be no enrichment, and no reactors. Over the course of the war, Groves encouraged a secret and extensive effort to identify all known uranium (and thorium) reserves in the world, and through secret contracts and agreements to secure control over them by the Anglo-American Combined Development Trust. By the end of the war, he felt certain that the United States had extended its monopoly forward by decades.

The US was ahead, Groves emphasized, and might remain so for some time, but could not rest on its achievements. Secrecy alone could not guarantee security, and the American military policy couldn’t rely on maintaining the present atomic monopoly, as Groves emphasized: “This is a secret that cannot be held; it is just a question of time.”43 It is worth highlighting how relatively nuanced this take on secrecy was, compared to both those who held “the secret” to be something totemic, and those who dismissed secrecy altogether, and it is in contrast with Groves’ usual reputation.

In this case, they created a new category of information entitled “restricted data.” “Restricted data” would be defined as “all data concerning the manufacture or utilization of atomic weapons, the production of fissionable material, or the use of fissionable material in the production of power.”69 This seemingly straightforward definition is in fact extraordinarily broad: the “secrets” in this case were defined by their nature and not by an act of regulation, which make them different from every other category of secrecy in the United States.
