		- Newsroom decision-making is often ad-hoc; make a million different decisions and stories get done for a million different reasons
			- Current situation:
				- no real content strategy
				- Low-hanging digital fruit is done: (search)
			- What is this work:creating a framework for storytelling and content selection
				- story form, story selection, story identification
				- Getting away from "Feels Like a Story To Me" as the key decisionmaking input
		- Too much print-centric decision making:
			- e.g. education does a single, long-form narrative story centered around the idea of a "Sunday reader" that hits 17 districts in paragraphs. Could be both more search optimized, scannable, deep dives on single districts.
