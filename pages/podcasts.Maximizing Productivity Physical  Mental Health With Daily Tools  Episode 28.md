	  Speaker 1: Tends to be two hours before 
	  
	  Speaker 0: my typical wake up time. And I want to know that number. It's called our temperature minimum. So if you're somebody that typically wakes up at eight AM. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: Then your temperature minimum is sometime around six a.m. Remember the temperature minimum is a time 
	  
	  Speaker 0: In the 24 hour cycle. I don't care what my actual temperature 
	  
	  Speaker 1: is. I care 
	  
	  Speaker 0: when my lowest temperature is and I know that that lowest temperature 
	  
	  Speaker 1: is approximately 
	  
	  Speaker 0: two hours before my average wake up time. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: So I highly recommend that you write down when you wake up

	  Speaker 1: There are two papers that I'd like to 
	  
	  Speaker 0: highlight in particular that relate to this phenomenon. The first one was published in the journal neuron and the title of this paper is whole brain functional ultrasound imaging. That just means they have a cool technique to evaluate the activity of structures in the brain across the entire brain

	  Speaker 0: some optic flow, but nothing like the sort of optic flow that you can generate in larger environments, like out of doors, environments. If you can't get outdoors, doing it indoors is perfectly fine, but it's not going to have the same magnitude of positive effect. Now in order to get the alertness, I do it outdoors because I also want sunlight in my eyes. I know many of you have heard me talk about this ad nauseam on various podcast in this podcast. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: But 
	  
	  Speaker 0: getting sunlight in your eyes first thing in the morning is absolutely vital to mental and physical health. It is perhaps the most important thing that any and all of us can and should do in order to promote metabolic wellbeing, promote the positive functioning of

	  Speaker 1: you may be different. Either way, I forced 
	  
	  Speaker 0: Myself essentially to drink at least 16 and most days, 32 oz of water. I also put a little bit of sea salt in the water. As many of you know, neurons require ionic flow. What that means is neurons need sodium, They need magnesium and they need potassium in order to function. We do tend to get dehydrated at night, even if the day is not very hot. I try and top off or I try and make sure that I'm hydrated early in the day before I

	  Speaker 1: my preferred sources tend to avoid coffee these days. Occasionally I have a cup, but most often I stick to the tease. 
	  
	  Speaker 0: I drink water as much as I feel I need to and want to. And I also drink my athletic greens which is compatible, at least for me with fasting. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: Let's talk about 
	  
	  Speaker 0: why fasting works to create this heightened state of alertness. Yet calm brain state. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: Fasting increases levels of 
	  
	  Speaker 0: adrenaline also called epinephrine in the brain and body. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: And when our levels of epinephrine and adrenaline are increased, we learn better. We can focus better. There's terrific

	  Speaker 1: if I had been struggling with that and I confess, 
	  
	  Speaker 0: you know there are times when for whatever reason something going on in life, it's been harder to put away the phone. I will sometimes put in my car. I used to joke that I used to throw it up on the roof or something like that. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: Look I've done and 
	  
	  Speaker 0: I suggest people do whatever they need to in order to self regulate that activity.

	  Speaker 1: A powerful way in which you can place the timing of this 90 minute work about in 
	  
	  Speaker 0: an optimal way. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: You have access to a very important piece of data that dictates when 
	  
	  Speaker 0: this about should start more or less and when it should end 
	  
	  Speaker 1: that piece of data is your temperature minimum. If you're somebody who wakes 
	  
	  Speaker 0: up on average at seven a.m. Well then your temperature minimum is five a.m. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: And you can be reasonably sure I want to _ reasonably, but you can be reasonably sure that your best work is going to be done anywhere from four 
	  
	  Speaker 0: to six hours after your temperature minimum. So for me I tend to wake up

	  Speaker 1: if you're interested in the specifics of those protocols, please see those episodes. However, right now, I just want to emphasize how the data

	  Speaker 0: well as pleasant. I like those rest days. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: But essentially the structure of the exercise regimen that works for sake of supporting health is going to be one in which there is a 3-2 ratio where for a 12 week period, or so. Maybe 10-12 weeks. three of those five workouts per week emphasize strength and hypertrophy and the other
