Or serving your customers well? Or being a delightful place to work? Just because these goals are harder to quantify does not make them any less important.

	  We don’t believe in busyness at Basecamp. We believe in effectiveness. How little can we do? How much can we cut out? Instead of adding to-dos, we add to-don’ts.
