	  “It’s all about solving problems, not implementing features. Conventional product roadmaps are all about output. Strong teams know it’s not only about implementing a solution; they must ensure that solution actually solves the underlying problem. It’s about results.”

	  This role has been compared to “a mini CEO,” but we think that overstates the level of control most product people have. We prefer the analogy of the executive chef, the person who brings together kitchen staff, menu, and purchasing — and even trains the front-of-house staff — all in order to bring in customers, satisfy their hunger, and make money for the business. It is not enough for an executive chef to simply distribute the work, but each team member must understand whom they are serving, and why they are doing things a certain way, so as to create a seamless experience for the customer.

	  It is your vision for how your products will help achieve your organization’s strategic goals. A good roadmap inspires buy-in and over-delivery from your entire organization.

	  A traditional roadmap is not flexible enough for the lean and agile methods many teams have adopted, and it is often light on the strategic context necessary for teams to understand the overall vision.

	  In the 1980s, Motorola began using the term roadmap to align technology and product development. Technology roadmaps became widely accepted in the 1990s across the semiconductor industry and were eventually adopted by many other technology-driven organizations, including Microsoft, Google, and Oracle.

	  A Roadmap Should Focus on Delivering Value to Customers and the Organization Problem: You are shipping a lot but not making progress

	  Many teams have begun measuring the actual effect of additions or changes to their product on customer behavior and business results, but this is usually absent from the roadmap. The only criteria left for management to judge success of product development efforts, then, is whether the team shipped on time — but does being on schedule make any difference if you have no effect on customer behavior or business results?

	  Critically for the roadmap, these guardrails also provide a means of judging when you are done that is separate from the due dates. To return to our earlier example, you are done when you have an indestructible hose you can manufacture and sell at a profit.

When marketing is telling one story, sales is selling something different, and engineering is building something different still, then product management’s strategy is hollow and irrelevant. The roadmap must align all the stakeholders around a common product plan.”

What are priorities from the clinical team? What does security need in the roadmap? The product team is very much responsible for taking all of the different inputs and saying, ‘This is it.’”

	  We find that inexperienced product pros often jump to the solution. After all, we’ve been acculturated to have “the answer” since we were in kindergarten. It’s a natural bias we all have — we want the answer and we want to be problem solvers. The issue is that we go right to the solution (output) rather than do what experienced product pros do, which is focus on the problem (outcome). To take it a step further, the smartest product pros ask what outcomes they’re seeking and drive toward those.
