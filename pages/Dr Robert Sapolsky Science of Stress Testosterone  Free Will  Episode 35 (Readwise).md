	  Speaker 0: volume of things that are already strongly there. um 2nd way to think about it is, well, here's here's like my favorite finding about testosterone. Um and this, this was some wonderful work by a guy john Wingfield who is one of the best behavioral endocrinologists out there. And about 20 years ago he formulated what was called the challenge hypothesis of testosterone action. What does testosterone do? Testosterone is what you secrete when your status is being challenged and it makes it more likely that you'll do the behavior is needed to hold on to your status. Okay, so that's totally boring, lee

Okay, so that's totally boring, lee straightforward. If you're a baboon, if somebody is challenging your high rank, the appropriate response on your part is going to be aggression. Alright, so we've just got in through the back door, testosterone and

	  Speaker 0: as a show of conspicuous, like, you know, property that they have and in a setting like that. I mean, I haven't been able to take urine samples of those times, unfortunately, but that shows the flip side of it. If you have a species that hands out status in a very different sort of way testosterone is going to boost that also. Okay, so that generates a totally nutty prediction, wow, take people in a circumstance, they playing an economic game where you get status by being trustworthy and being generous in your interactions with the game. If you give people testosterone, does that make them more generous? And that's absolutely the case totally

	  Speaker 0: by being trustworthy and being generous in your interactions with the game. If you give people testosterone, does that make them more generous? And that's absolutely the case totally cool finding, um, showing you, I don't know, basically, if you took a whole bunch of buddhist monks and shot them up with testosterone, they'd get all competitive with each other as to who could do the most random acts of kindness. And if we have a societal problem with too much aggression, the first culprit to look at is not testosterone, the first to look at is that we hand out so much damn elevated status for aggression in so many circumstances. So I

	  Speaker 0: elevated status for aggression in so many circumstances. So I find that finding to be fantastic. Third thing about subtlety of testosterone, Okay, so like some subtler behavioral effects you give testosterone to people and they become more confident, they become more self confident. Well that's good people pay to take all sorts of nonsensical self help courses that will boost your self esteem and that's a good thing unless testosterone makes you more confident? That is inaccurate and you're more likely to barrel into wrong decisions. What shown in economic gameplay is the testosterone by

	  Speaker 1: do I relate to this other of my species? How do I relate to these goals. Is there anything that um, we can do better conceptualized the relationship between testosterone and dopamine and motivation, or would that just take us down the alleyways of neural pathways and the hypothalamus, which was fine too? 
	  
	  Speaker 0: Well, I think it's got lots to do with sort of this massive revision isn't about dopamine everyone. Since the pharaohs got brought up being taught, The dopamine is about pleasure and reward turns out it isn't, it's about anticipation of reward and it's about generating the motivation, the goal directed behavior needed to go get that reward and before you know it, you're

	  Speaker 0: which then takes us into, is your motivation to get up and like go, you know, hand out lots of soup in a soup kitchen for homeless people or is it to get up and go ethnically cleanse the village. Um, it's not much to do with what your makeup was before the testosterone got on board. So it's activating in an energetic sent testosterone within minutes increases glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. You're just more awake and alert and all of that. And that has a lot to do with what dopamine does. And as one might predict, then getting just the right levels of testosterone infused into your
