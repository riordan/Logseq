	  If we want teams of missionaries, it's essential that every person in the organization understands and is convinced—they need to be true believers. This requires an ongoing crusade of evangelizing—in recruiting, onboarding, weekly 1:1 coaching, all‐hands meetings, team lunches, and everything in between.

	  What does it mean to think like a product person? It means focusing on outcome. Considering all of the risks—value, usability, feasibility, and business viability. Thinking holistically about all dimensions of the business and the product. Anticipating ethical considerations or impacts. Creative problem solving. Persistence in the face of obstacles. Leveraging engineering and the art of the possible. Leveraging design and the power of user experience. Leveraging data to learn and to make a compelling argument.

	  Just to be perfectly clear here, at the performance review, nothing should be a surprise—everything should have already been discussed in depth, likely for months.

	  The idea is to anticipate the different concerns and objections that might come from key executives and stakeholders, take the time to consider and write up clear answers to these objections, and then review these responses with the people that have these concerns.

	  Your highest‐order contribution and responsibility as product manager is to make sure that what the engineers are asked to build will be worth building. That it will deliver the necessary results. This means working with designers and engineers to come up with solutions that are valuable, usable, feasible, and viable. That is product discovery, and that is what takes on the order of four solid hours a day.

	  sometimes we need to create artifacts (especially when team members are remote), but that is certainly not how we collaborate. In fact, these artifacts more often get in the way of actual collaboration.

	  PMs sometimes need coaching to realize that trust is most easily built if you do it before you need it. This requires deliberate effort. Try this exercise: Have the PM write down the list of people with whom she regularly collaborates. Add to the list any stakeholders whose input she regularly needs. Next, circle the three to five names that are most important to her having a successful outcome in her work. Finally, circle the names of the one or two people she most dreads having to deal with. Congratulations! You've identified the list of relationships in which this PM needs to invest.

	  But I interpret this signal very differently. It is my mind warning me of the consequences if I don't do my homework and truly prepare. The fear of looking clueless is what keeps me up late preparing, studying, thinking, writing, rehearsing, and iterating. Most important, the fear of looking clueless is also what pushes me to try out my article/talk/presentation beforehand on some people that I highly respect and I know will tell me honestly if I am not solid in my thinking or my delivery.
