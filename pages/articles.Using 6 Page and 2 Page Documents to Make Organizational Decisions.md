	  Full argument read before conversation starts: Questions that are asked after reading an entire document are informed by the complete picture rather than where the presenter is in the slides. I.e., it avoids the “I address that question in a later slide” problem.

	  Reader owns rate of information consumption: Written documents can be read at any pace and in any order. They can be pondered. Powerpoint forces a rate of information consumption of the presenter.

	  The most important aspect of document is the philosophy behind getting disparate stakeholders to “disagree and commit” consensus. The way it does this is to narratively walk through a background of the area, specifics of the problem, proposed solutions, and their tradeoffs to different stakeholders. When done well, this allows everyone to get in a room, discuss the global picture, and commit on the right decision, even if they still disagree with it.

	  Own misses: The document should not hide nor be defensive of misses of the authors. If there was a miss that changes how the new decision would be made, dispassionately state it.

	  Don’t assume other’s misses: Similarly, unless they agree it was a miss and on the lessons being relevant, the document should not be aggressive in highlighting misses of others as mis-decisions.

	  Disagreements need to be in the document: When there are unresolved disagreements of fact or ideal strategy between stakeholders, they need to be discussed before the document is reviewed and explicitly discussed as options, along with their tradeoffs. This usually means meeting with such stakeholders before the review, to ensure their opinions are understood and can be represented fairly.

	  Following from the philosophy of spending the right amount of time on background material, documents generally have the same coarse structure: 2 pages general background, 2 pages specific background, 2 pages action and plan

	  Avoid digressions and pedantic detail. This isn’t a thesis assessment, stakeholders will trust the writer with some details if they are show they are being honest about addressing all sides of the problem

	  Use Appendices: if it isn’t centrally important to the argument but might come up in discussion, move it to the Appendices.

	  Prefer short lists of inarguable points to longer bulldozer lists which introduce arguable points.

	  When you have done all the above, but find the body is still more than 6 pages it means that there is too much information needed for a 60 minute review to come to a consensus decision. Ideally that means you tease out separate decisions and author multiple documents with their own rounds of review.

	  Ideally no more than 10 people should be invited to participate in the discussion, otherwise you won’t close the conversation in 60 minutes. On the bottoms-up side this should be the document author and other stakeholders to talk to the detail or strongly affected by the decision outcome.
