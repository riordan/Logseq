And we don't have to unpack all of those because I will take like, all day. And it's a whole using your whole book exists. I do want to ask about one before we go into some of the other practices which is around leading, and the one that really intrigued me was Number four are right a lot, and you basically write that leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to discomfort in their beliefs. And I love this because I always think to myself. Yeah, dammit! Leaders should be right all the time. They're instinct should be damn good. Tell me more about that one, because that one made me chuckle a bit. 
	  
	  Speaker 0: Yeah, this is And and just to be clear, of course we did not right that that is

	  Speaker 0: right, a lot. In some ways it's very straightforward, which is that as you move up in early stage CEO, as they grow and progress, they need to be more in the mode of delegating important work and auditing work. But their most important job, frankly, is to make decisions, and many decisions will come to you whether that's presented with a spreadsheet of document power point. There's all kinds of data that we presented you with those decisions, but there are very, very few problems where the data give you the answer. At the end of the day, you're going to have to use your judgment. What right a lot refers to is number one. When those those leaders were confronted with those decisions that more often than not, they pick the right door. But the second part of the definition refers to, more importantly, how those leaders make decisions, which is, Ah, lot of people think that leadership is about They're very strong opinion arguing their opinion and winning that argument, and what great leaders do actually is they can stake out a position, but they're willing toe update, mean change their mind on what is the right answer based on new information. And, you know, even

And, you know, even Steve Jobs talked about this at Apple, where some product that they launched it ended up being a mistake, and there was one of his reports had been telling him all along. We shouldn't do this. We shouldn't do this. We shouldn't do this. And then after it launched and it failed, he came back that person and said, Why didn't you talk me out of this? And the guy said, Wait a minute, I I tried to talk you out of it. What are you talking about? And he said, Well, you didn't do a good enough job because you didn't present the evidence to me in a persuasive enough way to make me realize why your point of view is so important and so is thinking about it and framing it that way about

	  Speaker 1: So a common misconception. It's well, now it's just the best writers. Instead of the best presenters that went out in narratives, we haven't found that to be the case. It's really the best thinkers, right, the best narratives and some of the best narratives I've ever read our by people whose first language is not English. 
	  
	  Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact, the best narratives of many of them written by a suffer development engineers who may not have even focused on their writing skills a good narrative. It's a very data based in fact based document, and writing good narratives is way harder than making a good power point. And I think, honestly, you know, a lot of companies don't do this just because it's it's hard when column. I've brought this to other companies. What tends to happen mostly, is that the author will vomit out about 25 pages of just sort of raw data at you, getting that person to then shape it and narrow it down to six pages of well, thought out. Narrative is really hard, you know. By the way, if you spend 10 hours a day reading detailed narratives like I Gotta Tell You, it could be mentally

	  Speaker 0: I think he made the observation wants the Amazon has like a narrative information multiplier. It's a strategic advantage that the company has over other companies because their executives are like 7 to 8 times better informed about what's happening in their company, and they're able to give super granular specific feedback to those teams. 
	  
	  Speaker 1: It allowed the S team to stay connected at a much deeper level. As Amazon started to move into more and more businesses. Hispanic control of the S team didn't grow by 100 X, but still relatively small team. And they are just a Z involved when it was a small company, as they are now on. It's a large company. The other thing I'd add about narratives is it does remove

There's no sound, they're entering questions. And sometimes the presenting team can answer the quick questions and write in the comments. So for that 20 minutes, really, there's a huge transfer of information that you can't see and then the rest of the 40 minutes is really just high quality Q and A and discussion on the questions that have already been entered or that come up the six page narrative is a forcing function to where you can cover that amount of information in a one hour meeting.

And at the end of the meeting, you are tying it up and wrapping it up and saying Either No, we agree that what you've written this document, that plan works approved. Go ahead or you debate and discuss it. One of the things you might do at the end of the document is make a clear section after you've presented all the facts to say, What are the decisions we need to make today and then list those out? Or what are the important parts of this plan where we need your feedback and input like we're not sure whether we should go down path A or path? Be a good document will clarify.

And what can we do better? And what are the key initiatives coming up for the next year, you can have Appendices two and the pendency zehr supplemental data that everyone is not required to read in the narrative meeting. But if you do need to go jump to it to answer a question, you can. 
	  
	  Speaker 0: It would include tables with like Here's a summary of our financial results from the prior year. Here's the table of the summary of our plan for the next year.

	  Speaker 1: They also work very well with design, which you may not think about at first. But if you're going over mock ups, either you I mock ups for a nap or physical prototypes of some hardware or process that you're gonna build, having a narrative actually helped set the stage to say, before we take a look at anything, Here's what we're trying to accomplish with the user experience here, our goals here, the challenges that we're trying to solve. You know, I've been at mock up meetings where everyone thinks through you, I expert, but if you don't have that before they comment on, you know, three or four things where we should move this over here. But you don't do that. If you everyone's on the same page with reading. Ah, short narrative beforehand.

	  Speaker 2: your book, you write that tenants give the reader and anchor point from which to evaluate the rest. But here's the best part. If the tenant itself is in dispute, it's easier to address that directly rather than take on all the logical steps that derive from that position. And

	  Speaker 0: I have since gone on. And one of the things that shocked me was that certain topics get, like, recycled for debate constantly. Right? And I was like, 
	  
	  Speaker 2: Whoa, we don't 
	  
	  Speaker 0: We don't do that. We didn't do that back at Amazon. Well, why is that? And one is the use of of attendant, which is that all of that debate and discussion could land on a fundamental issue about like what this company should or should not do. And if you don't come to a common agreement on it, then you will be constantly you away so much time with relitigating thes issues. The second reason is that what the narrative process forces you to do is by actually putting down on a piece of paper not only the tenant, but then cure. So

	  Speaker 2: me. And then when you do decide to relitigate, it's an actual intent versus an accidental every new hire repeating recycling the conversation.

	  Speaker 1: They also work very well with design, which you may not think about at first. But if you're going over mock ups, either you I mock ups for a nap or physical prototypes of some hardware or process that you're gonna build, having a narrative actually helped set the stage to say, before we take a look at anything, Here's what we're trying to accomplish with the user experience here, our goals here, the challenges that we're trying to solve. You know, I've been at mock up meetings where everyone thinks through you, I expert, but if you don't have that before they comment on, you know, three or four things where we should move this over here. But you don't do that. If you everyone's on the same page with reading. Ah, short narrative beforehand.

	  Speaker 0: I have since gone on. And one of the things that shocked me was that certain topics get, like, recycled for debate constantly. Right? And I was like, 
	  
	  Speaker 2: Whoa, we don't 
	  
	  Speaker 0: We don't do that. We didn't do that back at Amazon. Well, why is that? And one is the use of of attendant, which is that all of that debate and discussion could land on a fundamental issue about like what this company should or should not do. And if you don't come to a common agreement on it, then you will be constantly you away so much time with relitigating thes issues. The second reason is that what the narrative process forces you to do is by actually putting down on a piece of paper not only the tenant, but then cure. So
