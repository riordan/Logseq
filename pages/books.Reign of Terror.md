	  A circumscribed, managed quagmire could even ultimately comport with America’s broader hegemonic position of open-ended foreign deployments pursued in the name of what Washington called the “rules-based international order.” Those elites were so implicated in providing neither peace nor victory that it would be easy to discredit them in the eyes of those to whom that was intolerable: the people who had listened to what they said.

	  Trump brought aspects of the war home, but fundamentally the war was always home. For the 9/11 generation, the first generation to be extremely online, the War on Terror was an early red pill, releasing an omnidirectional, violent nihilism that viewed itself as the only rational, sophisticated, honorable, and even civilized option. Its culture was one of manufactured outrage, self-congratulation, and obedience to authority that convinced itself it was transgressive.

	  Occasionally the legal and political structures that, in a mature democracy, were supposed to constrain this apparatus succeeded in rolling back some of its operations. More often they reacted deferentially, leaving the bedrock of the War on Terror intact. As they did, they incrementally hollowed out the institutions all this security machinery was predicated on defending.

	  A war that never defined its enemy became an opportunity for the so-called MAGA coalition of white Americans to merge their grievances in an atmosphere of righteous emergency. That impulse unlocked a panoply of authoritarian possibilities that extended far beyond the War on Terror, from stealing children to inciting a violent mob that attempted to overturn a presidential election. Those options were enabled by how deeply the Forever War had eroded the legal, political, cultural, and economic armor surrounding American democracy.

	  The War on Terror was by no means the only factor enabling Trump’s rise. But it was a path to power for the others. It revitalized the most barbarous currents in American history, gave them renewed purpose, and set them on the march, an army in search of its general.

	  the crowning barbarism that sums up all the daily barbarisms; that it is Nazism, yes, but that before they were its victims, they were its accomplices; that they tolerated that Nazism before it was inflicted on them, that they absolved it, shut their eyes to it, legitimized it, because, until then, it had been applied only to non-European peoples; that they have cultivated that Nazism,

	  Beam drew on his Vietnam service not only for militancy and authority but to construct what Belew calls a narrative of “stymied grief, constant danger, fixation on weapons and betrayal” by elites whose horrific war had become a “catalyst for American decline.” Remaining leaderless was both a tactical necessity and a key component of their political strategy. It would allow for a broad disavowal of any individual act of violence, particularly from their politicians, whose objective was to enter “mainstream ‘kosher’ associations that are generally seen as harmless.”

	  As with Ruby Ridge, the press reported McVeigh’s “survivalism” as his most salient feature, and his motivations “anti-government.” Both characterizations made McVeigh’s mission seem politically agnostic. You didn’t have to be a white supremacist to consider the government tyrannical—you didn’t even have to be right wing.

	  There were no calls from newspaper columnists to send elite commandos into places like Elohim City. Shooting suspected white supremacist guerrillas on sight, deporting them, seizing whites from their airplane seats for the misfortune of being the wrong race in the wrong place at the wrong time were unthinkable options. Yet white supremacist terrorism was the oldest, bloodiest, and most resilient terrorism in the history of the United States. Its justifications and its symbolism were rooted in the American national heritage, making its appeal to Americans orders of magnitude larger than Islamic terror could ever claim. Its soldiers called themselves Patriots. Their enemies were America’s enemies.

	  But the cautious Clinton spoke against generic “hatred,” rather than white supremacy specifically. Limbaugh called the president “irresponsible and vacuous,” determined to ensure that the right be “permanently disqualified and silenced” through a campaign of innuendo. Newt Gingrich, the architect of a historic GOP congressional victory based on white backlash to Clinton, denounced as “grotesque and irresponsible” the idea that mainstream conservative rhetoric lent legitimacy to acts of terrorism like McVeigh’s. A political context like that meant there would be no urgency to pass legislation addressing the worst act of terrorism in American history. Although Clinton had promised “certain, swift, and severe” justice for Oklahoma City, no bill was passed until April 1996, largely thanks to the House, led by Gingrich. Congressional hearings on Waco and Ruby Ridge undercut any Republican willingness to give federal authorities more power; four months after Oklahoma City, Randy Weaver and his surviving family won a $3.1 million wrongful-death suit against the federal government.

	  what remained in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act was extraordinary. In addition to making the American carceral state more lethal, the bill contained sweeping expansions of government authority to combat terrorism—but only the sort of terrorism that didn’t involve white supremacists. Congress used Oklahoma City as an opportunity to give prosecutors greater authority to more easily convict people in the United States of ties to foreign, typically nonwhite terrorist groups, rather than those allied with McVeigh and Millar.

	  For good measure, a bill ostensibly aimed at responding to Oklahoma City included a congressional finding that Clinton ought to take “all necessary means, including covert action and military force” to destroy “terrorist infrastructure,” but only that belonging to “international terrorists,” such as “overseas terrorist training facilities and safe havens.”

	  When terrorism was white, the prospect of criminalizing a large swath of Americans was unthinkable. When terrorism was white, the collective American response was to focus the machinery of its wrath anywhere else, sparing white supremacy the expansive violence America pledged against terrorism that was foreign, Muslim, nonwhite.

	  Obama considered the drone strikes a responsible, calibrated use of lethal force, a weapon of precision, not one suited to indiscriminate killing. To guard against their excesses, Obama created a simulacrum of due process, which technocratic liberalism trusted to yield responsible outcomes, known as the disposition matrix. This framework empowered intelligence officials, who “nominated” someone for “disposition,” and lawyers, who labored to impose consistency on this expanding enterprise.

	  Obama and his officials found the term “War on Terror” as embarrassing as the Department of Homeland Security’s color-coded ladder boxes that presumed to quantify justified fear—and jettisoned them both. They instead tended to refer to a “sustainable” approach to counterterrorism.

	  the dominant American reception to accounts of civilian deaths and other atrocities was indifference. In a typical comment, Gian Gentile, a retired army colonel and insightful counterinsurgency critic, predicted, “these wikileaks [sic] on Afghanistan will be front page for a day or two then swept into the dustbin of history where the only folks interested will be wonks, experts, historians doing current history, and military bloggers.” Rarely did anyone shrugging off the revelations grapple with the implication that brutality committed by Americans and their proxies was unremarkable.

	  The Pentagon’s WikiLeaks Task Force found in 2011 that twenty-three soldiers in Afghanistan had their full names and Social Security numbers exposed, and that “risks” to local informants and U.S. intelligence capabilities did result. But it could not connect Manning’s disclosures to anyone who suffered physical harm. The task force further reported that the helicopter crew from “Collateral Murder” had been found to have followed the rules of engagement “to a satisfactory degree” and overall concluded that “there is not any significant ‘strategic’ impact to the release of this information.”

	  Much of the coverage of the time focused on the retroactive legal immunity the new law afforded the telecommunications firms. But the broader tectonic shift, a milestone in what Shoshana Zuboff calls “surveillance capitalism,” rendered those traditional phone companies and internet service providers less relevant than the emergent giants of a maturing internet.
