	  12 The most vocal critics were the African delegation to Tunisia, which as a group was largely unimpressed by the demonstration and voiced concerns about project and infrastructure costs, resources diverted from clean water and better schools, and machine obsolescence and recycling.13 But these voices were quickly marginalized within the broader discourse around the hundred-dollar laptop.

	  In place of the abandoned hand crank, Negroponte filled his presentation with unsubstantiated stories of children teaching themselves English and their parents to read, of impromptu laptop-enabled classrooms under trees, and of laptop screens being the only light source in a village (never mind how the laptops were recharged).

	  These claims became part of the allure of One Laptop per Child’s machine. As with many who lead development projects, Negroponte and OLPC’s other leaders and contributors wanted to transform the world—not only for what they believed would be for the better but, as we will see, in their own image. “Technology is the only means to educate children in the developing world,” Negroponte told the MIT Technology Review in October 2005. Later, he said that the laptop project “is probably the only hope. I don’t want to place too much on OLPC, but if I really had to look at how to eliminate poverty, create peace, and work on the environment, I can’t think of a better way to do it.”19

	  the same utopian impulses that inspired OLPC had also inspired previous starry-eyed projects in education and development—and they have continued to inspire subsequent projects, from massive open online courses (or MOOCs) to makerspaces, from technology-centric charter schools to coding boot camps.

	  More importantly, all of them have failed to achieve their utopian goals—yet it seems as if many technologists, designers, educators, policy makers, and others have failed to learn lessons from them, instead remaining moonstruck about the potential for technological transformation.

	  world. Part of OLPC’s allure was Negroponte’s stories about what the project would accomplish in the world. These referenced some powerful cultural mythologies, or foundational narratives that are ritualistically circulated within groups to reinforce collective beliefs. Mythologies have an element of enchantment to them, making certain futures appear at once magical and inevitable, straightforward and divine.

	  In Hall’s words, each of these ideologies “works” because it “represses any recognition of the contingency of the historical conditions on which all social relations depend. It represents them, instead, as outside of history: unchangeable, inevitable and natural.”33 Many of those speaking on behalf of OLPC were certainly discussing the project’s world-changing goals as “inevitable and natural”: as long as the project managed to get its laptops out in the world, success would follow.

	  This endeavor requires a social theory that can move with the laptop itself—something that can account for how these ideological commitments were designed and built into the laptop and how they traveled with it, while also accounting for the organizational, infrastructural, and cultural narratives that it either invoked or contradicted.

	  As Bruno Latour’s humorous analysis of the complicated dance between an automatic “door-closer” and the humans interacting with it shows, these nonhuman actors have agency—they can act on the world beyond the intentions of their designers—and the way that they reflect various ideological commitments can and often does shift between design and use.

	  a charismatic technology derives its power experientially and symbolically through the possibility or promise of action: what is important is not what the object is but how it invokes the imagination through what it promises to do.42 The material form of a charismatic technology may be part of this but is less important than a technology’s ideological commitments—its “charismatic promises.” This means that a charismatic technology does not even need to be present or possessed to have effects. A charismatic technology is thus an active subject within a sociotechnical web of other actors and social imaginaries—and its promises can be enthralling.

	  In their promises of action, however, charismatic technologies are deceptive: they make both technological adoption and social change appear straightforward instead of as a difficult process fraught with choices and politics. This gives charismatic technologies a spirit of technological determinism (or “technological solutionism”), whereby progress that a technology is supposed to cause is framed as natural and inevitable, thus overriding individual, social, institutional, or other kinds of agency—much like the “exceptionalism” of Weber’s charismatic leaders.

	  Scholars in STS have been studying technological determinism for decades now and have sussed out the many ways it is wrong.46 But outside of those circles—and particularly in the technology development and design world—the belief is still commonplace. It can lead believers to underestimate the sustained commitments (social, political, financial,

	  charisma’s naturalizing force can make critique and debate appear unnatural—they are, after all, up against what appears to be a natural and inevitable path toward technologically determined progress.

	  Historians have shown us, for instance, that when the United States was building its rail network in the mid-nineteenth century, the feelings of sublime awe and transcendence that the locomotive evoked across the nation led the United States to pay an enormous price in resources and lives in an attempt to realize the utopian promises of rail: the end of wars and parochialism, the merging of cultures, the very “annihilation of space and time.”47

	  A charismatic technology may promise to transform its users’ sociotechnical existence for the better, but this book will show that charisma is, at heart, ideologically conservative. Charismatic leaders confirm and amplify their audiences’ existing ideologies to cultivate their appeal, even as they may paint visions of a better world.50 A charismatic technology’s appeal likewise confirms the value of existing stereotypes, institutions, and power relations. This unchallenging familiarity is what makes a charismatic technology alluring: even as it promises certain benefits, it simultaneously confirms that the ideological worldview of its audience is already right—the charismatic technology will simply amplify it.

	  By referencing and reinforcing existing ideological norms, charismatic technologies can also, by extension, appear unchangeable, inevitable, and natural—and their promises may still hold power even when a technology does not deliver.

	  Indeed, since the Industrial Revolution, a faith in technology has played a major role in cultural cohesion. Rob Kling has shown that during the Great Depression of the 1930s, for instance, an “almost blind faith in the power of the machine to make the world a better place helped hold a badly shattered nation together.”

	  In the technology world, these social imaginaries can inspire nostalgic design, and chapter 2 shows how this nostalgia played out in the design of OLPC’s XO laptop. Key features of this laptop—focused on play, freedom, and connectivity—were based on how a number of OLPC developers nostalgically remembered their own (often privileged and idiosyncratic) childhoods rather than on contemporary childhoods in the Global South. Moreover, they smoothed away the messiness in their own experiences by understanding their childhoods through the social imaginary of the technically precocious boy, at
