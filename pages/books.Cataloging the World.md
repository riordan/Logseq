	  Otlet had long since imagined that his universal knowledge repository could extend well beyond being a bibliographical catalog. As he continued to work on the Universal Decimal Classification, he realized that the system could encompass not only books but also periodicals, photographs, moving pictures, audio recordings, maps, or even museum collections—anything that could be described in terms of a set of subjects. He also began to expand the definition of what might constitute a “document.” Today, most of us would likely associate the term with one or more pieces of paper. By the nineteenth century, however, that term had become increasingly anachronistic. Otlet proposed a far broader definition, suggesting that “document” could refer to any object manifesting any kind of graphic symbols—letters, numbers, images—captured in any form of media in order to express any form of human thought. Otlet eventually came to use the shorthand “book,” anticipating an ever-expanding landscape of information in which almost any object can serve as a document.

	  The Scotsman’s work offered a path beyond mere classification; it represented a new way of thinking about the spatial representations of knowledge. By incorporating visual indexing techniques and assigning labels to clusters of related documents, Geddes also imagined the museum evolving into a kind of encyclopedic enterprise.

	  Otlet harbored a more expansive vision, in which the universal book would ultimately take the form of an entire World City, one whose contents might be read in the same way that medieval Europeans “read” the architectural features of the great cathedrals
