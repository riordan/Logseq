	  THE LASER WAS NOT so much a single invention. Rather, it was the result of a storm of inventions during the 1960s. Noteworthy improvements (like a new design) or variations (like getting a new material to “lase”) followed one after another in rapid succession. Sometimes only a few days separated the announcements of new developments.

	  John Pierce told an interviewer around that time. “You can’t clearly see that it will be of any use in communication. I mean, we certainly can’t guarantee that. But it has that potentiality.” Pierce added that “when something as closely related to signaling and communication as this comes along, and something is new and little understood, and you have the people who can do something about it, you’d just better do it, and worry later just about the details of why you went into it.”

	  “He went around the world at that time, in 1960, trying to find good people—that’s all he wanted, good people,” recalls Herwig Kogelnik. “And then he would try to persuade them to switch their disciplines to take on what he called ‘laser and optical communications research.’”

	  Kogelnik was a plasma physicist, which meant he studied the physics of certain gases. Rudi Kompfner didn’t care. His simple argument to Kogelnik on the day they met was that the young man should think of the high frequency of light and what that could mean in terms of its capacity for information. Colleagues all recall the charm as well as the passion that animated Kompfner. To Kogelnik, he just said, “Think of all this bandwidth!”—a line that inspired Kogelnik to switch from plasma to lasers. “I had invested many, many years in plasma physics. And he persuaded people like me to totally throw away their past and start in a new field.”13

	  What was also attractive were the economics of optical transmission. For decades, the Bell System had realized that it was far more cost-efficient to mix together many hundreds of conversations on an intercity copper cable—by a complex technical means, the signals could be sent together at a higher frequency and then teased apart at the receiving ends. Sending more information and sending it more economically were often the same thing.

	  There was, perhaps, another option. It was the idea of a scientist well outside the elite ranks of Bell Labs. In 1966, an engineer named Charles Kao, employed in England by International Telephone and Telegraph, visited the Labs to talk about a technology he was researching in Europe. Kao had recently delivered a paper at an engineering conference in London suggesting that transparent glass fibers, carrying waves of light, might solve the transmission problem. Some of the scientists at Bell Labs had already toyed with this possibility. It had long been clear to engineers that thin glass strands could transport light for short distances; such fibers, in fact, were already being used in medicine, where they were proving useful for gastrointestinal examinations. But those working in the communications field doubted that glass fibers could transport signals the much greater distances the phone system required. The glass just wasn’t clear enough. A signal would be lost—technically speaking, it would scatter and attenuate—after only a few dozen meters. Fibers were, as the engineers put it, too “lossy.” Kao was more optimistic. He had spent the past few years in Europe doing deep exploratory research, and he had determined there was no fundamental reason why strands of exceedingly pure glass couldn’t carry signals substantial distances. His paper was partly theoretical. Glass of the sort Kao was talking about didn’t really exist; even the clearest glass on earth would effectively absorb or scatter light and thus kill a signal in a few dozen meters. But Kao hadn’t said that pure glass would replace wires or waveguides immediately. He had only concluded it was possible. He was also liberated to some extent from the pressures that shaped the views of the Bell Labs scientists. Labs upper management had bet the future on waveguides, but Kao had not.

	  Phone engineers in Europe—Kao included—weren’t looking for a complex new technology, such as the waveguide, for intercity communication. They needed intracity communication. Generally speaking, Europe’s metropolitan areas were both denser than America’s and closer to other metro areas. The British telecom planners, Jeff Hecht notes, “wanted better technology to send signals between local switching centers that typically were a few miles apart.

	  The CCD was a light-sensitive electronic sensor that used the varying responses of electrons to different amounts of light to create photographs and images of extraordinary detail.26 The CCD would become the foundation of digital photography as we now know it, but Bill Baker perceived its value to national security long before its commercial potential was understood. “I took it out to the NRO immediately,” Baker would later recall, knowing that the National Reconnaissance Office, the spy satellite agency he had helped found, could use it for espionage.27

	  The integrated circuit of Kilby and Noyce, which built on the engineering and materials-science achievements of Bell Labs, seemed more a missed opportunity than a misstep.28 But nobody could offer such a mitigating rationale to explain the waveguide and Picturephone, two interrelated and fabulously expensive follies.29 It seems worth considering not only how those endeavors failed, but what those failures represented. Innovators make different kinds of mistakes. The waveguide, for instance, might be considered a mistake of perception. It was an instance where a technology of legitimate promise is eclipsed by a breakthrough elsewhere—in another corporate department, at another company, at a university, wherever—that solves a particular problem better. It was perhaps understandable, moreover, that a breakthrough in the creation of pure glass fibers wouldn’t come from an organization such as Bell Labs, where materials scientists were experts on the behaviors of metals, polymers, and semiconductor crystals. Rather, it would come from a company like Corning, with over a century of expertise in glass and ceramics.

	  Mistakes of perception are not the same as mistakes of judgment, though. In the latter, an idea that developers think will satisfy a need or want does not. It may prove useless because of its functional shortcomings, or because it’s too expensive in relation to its modest appeal, or because it arrives in the marketplace too early or too late. Or because of all those reasons combined. The Picturephone was a mistake in judgment.

	  For years, Bell Labs executives in Murray Hill, Holmdel, and Whippany had communicated with one another via Picturephones in their offices. “I used it all the time,” Dorros recalls. “I used it every day. I thought it was terrific.” Not all the directors and vice presidents, however, liked the service. Rudi Kompfner, for instance, positioned a still photograph of himself in front of his set—in John Pierce’s admiring recollection, the image showed Kompfner to be remarkably attentive and invariably interested in whatever was being said—so that he could move about his office during a chat.

	  In the view of Ross and others, such efforts probably helped delay a variety of antitrust actions. Ross recalls, “Kelly set up Sandia Labs, which was run by AT&T, managed by us, and whenever I asked, ‘Why do we stay with this damn thing, it’s not our line of business,’ the answer was, ‘It helps us if we get into an antitrust suit.’ And Bell Labs did work on military programs. Why? Not really to make money. It was part of being invaluable.”

No one else has the network.” For a short while, at least, that was true. They didn’t realize at the time that anyone could build a network. •

	  As he saw it, though, Corning was still ahead of Bell Labs. “The progress made with optical fibers” at the Labs was outstanding, he noted, but it was not in the “breakthrough” class like Corning’s.17 Kompfner’s main advantage was that Bell Labs could throw almost unlimited amounts of talent and money at a problem, especially when solving it had such tantalizing potential. Optical fiber was exactly that kind of problem.

	  More to the point, the thrust of the work at Bell Labs seemed to have shifted decisively to big projects involving hundreds of people. Frenkiel’s Bell Labs didn’t seem to have anything to do with heroic research on a new amplifier, done by a few men in a hushed lab. It was about large teams attacking knotty problems for years on end.

	  It was Engel’s understanding that to get ahead at Bell Labs, “you were supposed to work on more than you were asked to work on.”6 It was necessary, in other words, not only to do your assigned work but to devote 20 or 30 percent of your time to another project.

That buzzing urged a Bell Boy user to get to a pay phone and call their office in case there was an emergency. To a systems engineer, the Bell Boy was not terribly interesting.

	  Indeed, to stroll around inside the Black Box at that time, one would not have imagined that a mobile telephone system was an on-ramp to the future. The thing about Bell Labs, Frenkiel remarks, was that it could spend millions of dollars—or even $100 million, which was what AT&T would spend on cellular before it went to market7—on a technology that offered little guarantee it would succeed technologically or economically. Indeed, a marketing study commissioned by AT&T in the fall of 1971 informed its team that “there was no market for mobile phones at any price.” Neither man agreed with that assessment.

	  He would later look back and see the early 1970s as a perfect example of what engineers sometimes call “steam engine time.” This term refers to the Scottish engineer James Watt, the inventor of the first commercially popular steam engine, whose name is also memorialized in the term we use to measure power. In the late 1700s, Watt made startling improvements upon more basic ideas of how to use compressed steam to run heavy machinery. The knowledge needed to make such an engine had by then coalesced to the point that his innovation was, arguably, inevitable. By the 1970s, the mobile business was ready to happen, Engel was sure, even if the marketers had their doubts. The technology was there. It was now just a matter of who was going to do it, and how fast they could make it work. “It was,” he says, “steam engine time for cellular.” The FCC’s decision to consider proposals for mobile radio had been the spark. But a number of other technologies made it steam engine time, too.

	  “Cellular is a computer technology,” Frenkiel points out. “It’s not a radio technology.” In other words, engineering the transmission and reception from a mobile handset to the local antennas, while challenging, wasn’t what made the idea innovative. It was the system’s logic—locating a user moving through the cellular honeycomb, monitoring the signal strength of that call, and handing off a call to a new channel, and a new antenna tower, as a caller moves along.

And now we come along to say we need to do locating and handoffs. And also, by the way, we need to keep track of the health of every base station in the system, we need trouble reports, we need to gather data for traffic.” The ESS—a switching system with a powerful computer embedded within it—could do all these things.

	  Should a cellular phone have a dial tone? Porter made a radical suggestion that it shouldn’t. A caller should dial a number and then push “send.” That way, the mobile caller would be less rushed; also, the call would be connected for a shorter time, thus putting less strain on the network. That this idea—dial, then send—would later prove crucial to texting technology was not even considered.

And therefore, going forward, no single lab could on its own provide the new technology for the entire electronics and information industry. At the same time, he noted, the reverse was true: The scientists and engineers at Bell Labs had been producing too many ideas over the past half century for a single company to handle:

	  one thing about Kelly impressed him above all else: It had to do with how his former boss would advise members of Bell Labs’ technical staff when they were asked to work on something new. Whether it was a radar technology for the military or solid-state research for the phone company, Kelly did not want to begin a project by focusing on what was known. He would want to begin by focusing on what was not known. As Pierce explained, the approach was both difficult and counterintuitive. It was more common practice, at least in the military, to proceed with what technology would allow and fill in the gaps afterward. Kelly’s tack was akin to saying: Locate the missing puzzle piece first. Then do the puzzle.

	  There are varying explanations as to why Shockley became fixated on genetics and race. Some former colleagues speculate that a serious car accident in the early 1960s may have led indirectly to changes in cognition. It’s worth asking, however, whether Shockley’s fixation was merely an accentuation of beliefs he had long harbored. Fred Seitz, who accompanied Shockley on a cross-country car trip in 1932 from California to the East Coast, remarked that even as a young man, Shockley was warm to the idea that intellectual superiority should be rewarded with authority and influence. “He was inclined to believe that society should be governed by what one might regard as an intellectually elite group . . . rather than by majority decisions as in a democratic society.”12 Shockley maintained a heightened interest in IQ scores all through his life. He would become notorious for screening some of the applicants at Shockley Semiconductor, in 1956 and 1957, through psychological and intelligence tests. But

	  In fact it was only a temporary setback. In Shockley’s case, the leap from his early question (How does intelligence translate into scientific creativity?) to his later question (How do genes influence intelligence?) was not especially controversial. But then came a more precarious leap: How does race determine intelligence? It was likely the case, as some of Shockley’s former colleagues contend, that he didn’t begin his effort out of any deep-seated bigotry. But it is almost certainly true that Shockley’s sensitivity to rejection led him in that direction.

	  Almost certainly the dinner conversation exemplified how Shockley seized every moment that he was not at the Bell Labs offices as an opportunity to discuss eugenics. The agreement he had struck with Morton stipulated that he would refrain from mixing his racial theories, which he pursued most of the year out of his home in California, with his development work at Bell Labs. It soon became clear, however, that Shockley could barely abide by such an agreement. Indeed, after only a few years of consulting work at the Labs, he asked to scale back. Dysgenics was now his actual career; the main thrust of Shockley’s life from 1970 on was to attract attention to the idea.

	  The great tragedy of Bill Shockley’s life, Ian Ross remarks, was that he did almost nothing of scientific worth after leaving Bell Labs. Arguably, his successes were as a teacher and as an impresario of talent—that is, in assembling the team at Shockley Semiconductor that ultimately drove the success of America’s computer chip industry. “Had he stayed in that environment,” Ross says of Bell Labs, “it would have been a very different story.” With a larger enveloping group, in other words—with a slew of supervisors who understood how to compensate for his weaknesses, and a veritable army of technicians who could prepare semiconductor materials to exacting specifications—Shockley might not have been overcome by his poor management skills and defective judgment.

	  But Mathews recalls that one evening in 1957, at a classical music concert that Pierce and Mathews attended, “Pierce said, ‘You get sound out of a computer now, you get numbers out of sound, if you write a different program, maybe you can get computers to make music.’ He said, ‘Take a little time from your computer work and try that.’” Mathews went on to become one of the pioneers of computer-generated music. He and Pierce and Baker justified the research to AT&T management by explaining, truthfully, that it would yield insights into computer-synthesized speech, which was considered useful for the phone system.

	  And—like Shannon, like Pierce—Baker spent a fair amount of time out of the office collecting awards and honorary degrees. He seemed especially willing to rehash old histories from the glory days. In his personal letters, in fact, Baker sometimes seemed as if he were writing for posterity, creating long and often simplistic narratives of what had been complex innovations. His rendering of the past seemed geared to redound to the greater glory of the Young Turks’ Bell Labs, the Bell Labs that existed before the phone monopoly was broken up by lawsuits and regulators. “Happily, the science and technology that you remember in some of your writings is flourishing still,” he wrote to his old friend Clark Clifford in 1991.

	  By 2002, the institution Baker had helped build had become unrecognizable to him. “There isn’t any institution,” he dismissively told an interviewer when asked about his former employer. “Bell Labs does not exist as an institution.”40 This was not precisely true. Yet to Baker, for a number of reasons, it recalled something he’d said years before. If the phone company were broken up, he remarked in 1974, its long-term research efforts would become untenable and “Bell Laboratories would cease to exist.”

	  As Pierce saw it, the great laboratories of the twentieth century had a clear purpose: “Someone depended on them for something, and was anxious to get it. They were really needed, and they rose to the need.” For Bell Labs, Pierce noted, the need was modern communications. That future rested upon the institution and the researchers who worked there. Pierce was now watching “as an interested onlooker” to see if the new AT&T Bell Laboratories could figure out a new mission, a new purpose. He wasn’t skeptical; he believed it was indeed possible. But he wasn’t terribly optimistic, either. The old world was already gone, he explained, it was just that most people hadn’t yet noticed. “It is just plain silly,” he wrote, “to identify the new AT&T Bell Laboratories with the old Bell Telephone Laboratories just because the new Laboratories has inherited buildings, equipment and personnel from the old. The mission was absolutely essential to the research done at the old Laboratories, and that mission is gone and has not been replaced.”2 •

It was not one concentrated and powerful machine; it was the meshing of many interlocking small parts grouped physically near enough to one another so as to make an equally powerful machine.

One seemingly insoluble problem was that New Jersey was too geographically diffuse for the Palo Alto model to work there. The universities that did exist, such as Princeton and Rutgers, were either too far away from one another or too theoretical in their scientific focus to act as fertile training grounds for East Coast entrepreneurs. What’s more, while Bell Labs was dynamic—the scientists and engineers there shared ideas and knowledge with one another and, to a certain extent, with their friends in the academy and other industrial labs—it was not as dynamic as Silicon Valley.12 In the Valley, engineers changed jobs constantly while companies formed and dissolved and then formed again, as if in constant agitation.

Without question, the size of the staff at Bell Labs, and its interdisciplinary nature, were large factors in its success, too. So was the steadiness of the Labs’ funding stream, guaranteed by the monthly bill paid by phone subscribers, which effectively allowed the organization to function much like a national laboratory. Bell Labs managers knew they could support projects—the undersea cable, for example, or cellular telephony—that might require decades of work. The funding stream also assured the managers that they could consistently support educational programs to improve the staff’s expertise and capabilities.

What seems more likely, as the science writer Steven Johnson has noted in a broad study of scientific innovations, is that creative environments that foster a rich exchange of ideas are far more important in eliciting important new insights than are the forces of competition.18 Indeed, one might concede that market competition has been superb at giving consumers incremental and appealing improvements. But that does not mean it has been good at prompting huge advances (such as those at Bell Labs, as well as those that allowed for the creation of the Internet, for instance, or, even earlier, antibiotics). It’s the latter types that pay to society the biggest and most lasting dividends.

	  Finally, something else seemed important. “A new device or a new invention,” Kelly once remarked, “stimulates and frequently demands other new devices and inventions for its proper use.”10 Just as the invention of the telephone had led to countless developments in switching and transmission, an invention like the transistor seemed to point to even more developments in switching, transmission, and computer systems. Or to put it another way, the solution to a technological problem invariably created other problems that needed solutions. So making something truly new seemed to ensure that you would be making something else truly new before too long.
