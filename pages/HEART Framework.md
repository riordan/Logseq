	- ### Happiness
		- Qualaroo happiness survey using [HaTS](https://research.google/pubs/pub43221/) (Happiness Tracking Surveys)
		- Enable baseline survey for 20% of traffic to the site on mobile and desktop
			- Survey at same percentage in experiment group.
				- Consider running an experiment to see if having Qualaroo appear with greater frequency affects HATS scores
		- Turn into metrics that can be used as part of ongoing experiments.
