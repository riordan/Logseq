title:: Admap

- ## Background
	- The Ad Map is a 2022 effort by [[inquirer/adsales]] to reassess the way we present online ads to optimize our advertising revenue.
	- Phase 1 was a research process to assess the ad systems we have today, how they relate to our page structure and advertising layouts, then make recomendations on ways to improve the ad infrastructure.
	- Phase 2 is a series of [experiments](((62ab7e3f-2617-40ed-b6b9-4611ecdc86bc))) to test how these recommendations come together as a series of [live audience tests]([[experimentation]]).
