	  Back in 1985 composer John Oswald had coined the term plunderphonics in an essay titled Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative. In this piece of writing he identified the moral and creative complexities which surround the act of sampling, but ultimately concluded that the practice was referential and self-conscious – a subversive tool which could be used to interrogate entrenched notions of identity and originality in music. This might explain why sampling became an intergenerational battleground in the late ‘80s and ‘90s, as young hiphop artists pioneering a new post-modern form of sound-collage butted heads with an ageing cadre of musicians who understandably took issue with the unauthorised use of their work as raw material.

	  hiphop production crews such as Public Enemy’s Bomb Squad took sampling to new levels of dynamic power. Just as The Avalanches were picking up pace, DJ Shadow released his genre-defining masterpiece ‘Endtroducing’, which used the plunderphonics template to evoke a creeping sense of pre-millennium tension – a mood that intersects with the neo-noir of Massive Attack and Portishead.

	  But as far as The Avalanches were concerned, this rather self-serious approach to sampling was never going to work. The band’s creative ethos centred on the feelings of joy and bliss that could be squeezed from every fraction of sound. For Chater, this need of a positive outlet was justified by the alcohol addiction which had been derailing his life since the age of fifteen. By the time he reached twenty-one his withdrawal issues had become so serious that he was admitted to intensive care for a number of weeks. As he recalls: “Since I Left You came maybe two years after that, when I was sober and just glad to be alive. That’s a lot of the feeling and the joyousness behind that album – me at 23, making music and just happy to be alive… .”

	  The total number of samples which would eventually feature on the album exceeded 3,500 – a figure which would be the source of a huge headache for the band when they were forced to retrace their steps and identify the source of this material due to the legal vulnerabilities of an international release.

	  Once the basic skeleton of a song was formed the pair would swap recordings and flesh out each others ideas, engaging in a collaboration that still allowed their individual imaginations to flourish. Nevertheless, the creative vibe was changeable – as Chater notes: “There were times when everyone’s in the studio and everyone’s bringing in records and it’s kind of spontaneous. But there were long periods of time where it was one person just slugging it out, and [that wasn’t] a party at all.”
