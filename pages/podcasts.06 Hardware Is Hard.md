	  Speaker 1: The crux of that disagreement was about whether to optimize for the speaker Ui or for the music service. You I and that's because of our first product structuralism lesson.

The things that turned out to be important for the long run also tended to be things that took quite a long time to move from inception to actual impact, but looking at like in financial terms here and now, it's not the kind of investment that make, that makes sense. But I think that's true for a lot of things that we've done over the years and a lot of things that are kinds of companies do.

	  Speaker 1: the best product strategy often requires playing the long game. To pull off these long term bets. You need to have a lot of convictions and in order to have a lot of conviction, you need a clear hypothesis and rationale for people to have the stamina to actually see it through because some of the biggest bets take the longest to pay off
