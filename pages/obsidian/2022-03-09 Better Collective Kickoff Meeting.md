##  Questions/notes from them
	- Always optimizing assets based on deals with partners
		- that changes, frequently
		- ![[Screen Shot 2022-03-09 at 11.19.43.png]]
		- This is usually coming out of an iframe
		- Dynamic content, care a lot about compliance; need to show geotargeted compliance messages and optimized offers
			- Existing infra for content serving = based on iframes
				- Dynamic show of
			- can do that with an iframe already but htey get that
			- Don't have to do js; they don't have JS implementation yet
			- Want chronological archive of all of the articles of all time. Very important to them for SEO
- Analytics from Lars:
	- monthly how many click, how many sign up, how many trigger new revenue
	- They get very little transparency from their partners
		- **- They sometimes put click trackers on these pages** to get meaningful metrics
		- Do quite a bit of GA integration; including Google Search Console
	- Want to be getting us onto apple news
- Mobile app: Would need to make sure it works for a mobile webview app and validate that the insertion
- Geofencing mechanics:
	- Regulations say you can/can't bet from a given state & each state has different rules
		- Operators will say if you come into a state where not legal, like CA; not allowed to sign up, not allowed to place bet
	- Do need to make sure showing compliance text
		- different compliance language state-by-state
	- Do a 24 hr geoip lookup cookie; Maxmind lookups
	- Try not to do state-by-state offers at this point
		- getting value from changing offers from fanduel -> ceasars
	- Operators using GeoComply app to get real lat/lon
	- Default to home state for an operator if they're coming from a location without it
	- **What % of audience using an adblock?**
		- Keep [[adblock]] detector w/ blocker off on the betting sections
		- Prefer to keep it off for paywall; this content will be unmetered
			- Telegraph keeps internal links
	- Care about % of adblocking; need to get them adblocked %; GATM-SS
	- Have sample code for integration with NY Post; would love to see how it works
