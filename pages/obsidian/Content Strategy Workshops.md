## [[2022-03-08]] -- Session 1: 

### Breakout session: Newsroom Goals and KPIs

What would be meaningful and motivating KPIs for the newsroom?

- Breakout Group Members:
	- [[Julia Haslinger]] - Facilitator
	- [[Katie Krzaczek]] - digital editor; started [[2022-03-01|Last Week]]
	- [[Charlotte Sutton]]
	- [[Gary Potosky]]
	- [[Megan Griffith-Greene]]


Theme: Driving Audience Growth
- Leading Indicators
	- Increasing Story volume

Notes:
- Do these things at individual desks; but have individual cadence and pace. Never said "Publish enterprise during peak enterprise days";
	- sports went to sports story of the day Monday -> Thurs after football season
	- Don't have alignment between different desks; all desks tracking what enterprise is doing locally
