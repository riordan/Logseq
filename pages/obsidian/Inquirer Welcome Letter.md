Dave Riordan - VP of Data and Insights

  

Overview

Welcome! Everyone at The Inquirer is thrilled to have you aboard. This document will provide some [helpful links](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/l/c/R7Kqu19s) and source material for your first few days. 

  

Ben Deane-Schierloh will be your “buddy” to help get you settled. I’ve asked him to make introductions, find links and documents, and generally be the person you can ask questions of while you’re learning about the company. 

  

As a reminder, you’ll be serving in the role of VP of Data and Insights. In this role you will:

  

Guide The Inquirer’s internal data and insights strategies, and define the tools and processes necessary to execute them

  

-   Evaluate our existing operational measurement capabilities and data platforms, and develop plans to augment and improve visibility to successes and areas needing improvement
    
-   Recommend new data collection, analysis, and activation technologies that fit our needs, ambitions and budgets
    
-   Develop communication strategies and training, as required, to make analysis and data science key parts of our product development and project management practices
    
-   Act as a trusted partner on strategic initiatives, particularly in developing measurement and data activation strategies for our most critical projects
    

  

Support and improve the operations of the company in each department 

  

-   As a part of The Inquirer’s Leadership team, liaise with other departmental leads to understand how data and reporting can help direct their strategic plans, and identify the information they each have that others would benefit from
    
-   Ensure our goals, and the strategies we use to accomplish them, are well-supported by data and analysis
    
-   Advance our experimentation capabilities for product development, marketing, advertising, and editorial use cases
    
-   Guide the discovery and implementation of advanced data products, including ML models, analytics-driven forecasts, and others, to add business & customer value.
    
-   Deliver findings / insights in clear, comprehensible ways across technical and non-technical audiences
    

  

Manage our team of analytics professionals

  

-   Guide the career development of ~8-10 professionals working in analysis, engineering, and data science
    
-   Provide technical oversight to improve on system capabilities, self-service functionality, query / aggregation efficiency, and quality of analysis
    
-   Suggest technologies to test that could accelerate our growth and/or simplify our tech stacks for data and reporting
    
-   Advocate for additions / changes to your team to better support the long-term goals of The Inquirer
    

  

People to Know

  

Your team:

-   Direct reports: 
    

-   Mark Loomis: Director of Analytics - leads the team that gathers data on editorial, marketing, ad, and financial performance. Originally came from Finance and has been here for a while, so knows a TON about the company. 
    
-   Brian Waligorski: Data Architect - Brian was recently hired (Sept) and is tasked with developing the technical architecture (product selection, data flow, etc.) He’s just emerging from learning mode and has been contributing, but job #1 is to work with him on building out that vision and starting to execute against it. 
    

-   The rest of the Data team (these are all Mark’s directs):
    

-   Kate Connolly: Senior Data Analyst, brilliant, been here quietly making things work for longer than I’ve been here. Unsung and underrecognized, definitely someone to help shine. 
    
-   Hawk Shannon: Newer hire looking at first-level data for Marketing, Audience and Product, primarily working within third-party tools like GA360, Data Studio, etc. Looking to expand tech skill and grow with the team. 
    
-   Julia Haslanger: A new hire coming to us from Hearken, WSJ, and a history in news. Focused on editorial data and aligned with the newsroom’s Audience team. 
    
-   Alex Williams: A recent transfer to the team from Ad Sales, she’s been focusing primarily on revenue / performance data and knows the new ad system (Naviga Plan, used for multiplatform sales and print space management) well. She’s working to improve her broader SQL and technical skills, which is one of the reasons for the transfer.
    
-   Daniel McNichol: Former Associate Director of Decision Science, working with us on a part-time basis until the end of the year. Knows all about the Newsroom Indexes, so definitely spend some time with him unpacking all that while you can (i.e. before the holiday break). This will be a key area of focus for the first quarter, and likely an ongoing thread.
    

Others:

-   [[Becky Bowers]]: Product Director. As you know, one of the nicest folks in the business. She’s been a force of nature, getting the Product team better organized and humming along. She’ll be working with you and your team to make sure our Product Development processes are data-driven, goal-oriented, and accountable to their results. 
    
 ^5m4e8x
-   [[Ben Deane-Schierloh]]: Agile Practitioner, soon-to-be Manager of Product Operations. Will be tasked with making our product development processes more data-driven, basically operationalizing Becky’s direction. 
 ^oncil1
 
-   [[George Kurtas]]: CIO - Absolute best. Thoughtful, and both strategic and detail oriented. Nearly singlehandedly holds our systems together and never asks for recognition. Probably the first person that the company should have a giant “key personnel” policy against. Has been trying to pull together a strategy for data policy / governance for a while but (a) is super busy and (b) this hasn’t been a priority for other areas of the company. Something to consider, how systems and policies should intersect. Definitely work with him on this. 
     ^nhzyok
-   [[Toan Dang]]: VP of Engineering - super knowledgeable leader who is the first person to call if you need help with engineering capacity, or if you need information on a particular system or widget. Knows everything. 
     ^vseb7u
-   [[Lindsay Grow]]: Manager, Product Design. Lindsay has a deep passion for user research and consistent design systems, and has been managing the day-to-day of the Product Design team including usability testing, surveys, and other design-focused research methods. Oversees Nicole:
     ^xy4m1o
 ^bbnm9k
-   [[Nicole Henninger]]: Senior User Researcher. A soon-to-be PhD in Neuroscience from Temple, supremely skilled in survey methods and execution. Early in 2022 I’m hoping to position her as a lead for cross-departmental qualitative user research.    
^d8rnaz
-   [[Patrick Kerkstra]]: Managing Editor for Digital. Your key senior contact in the newsroom for strategy, and for the Indexes that he and his editors use to help manage the performance process in the newsroom. Oversees the digital editors who are experimenting with new story forms, and will want to be able to plan and measure new experiments. 
     ^jjlub7
-   [[Pete Doucette]]: Chief Revenue Officer, overseeing Marketing, Advertising, and Customer Service. Great partner to have. Was previously at The Boston Globe and at FTI, a consulting firm that worked with tons of local and regional papers (including us in 2020.) 
 
 ^v1pfcl
-   [[Darya Ushakova]]: VP of Consumer Marketing. Came to us from the Chicago Tribune, and has been bringing a lot of her folks with her as openings have come up. Has built a great operation very quickly, and will likely be one of your most demanding (in a literal, non-judgmental way) partners.
    
 ^jy6z6p
-   [[Lydia Hamilton]]: VP of Operations. Working to make operational efficiency a key focus for all leads across the company. One of her priorities in 2022 is to establish a quarterly operations review of key metrics across the company. Lydia will be a key ally in getting data into our planning and execution processes.
    
 ^0x7p5a
-   [[Amanda Baker]]: Director of the Project Management Office. Previously was under George / Me, and is now working with Lydia to expand the impact and influence of the PMO across the company. She’s aiming to provide project management support to all internal projects, not just those with system implications.
    
 ^fd6vjd
-   [[Sarah Schmalbach]]: Director of the [[Lenfest Local Lab]]. Sarah and her team have done really innovative work around hyperlocal newsletters, NLP-based mapping, and how tech can help us better understand our DEI gaps. 
     ^em1ucq
-   [[Ross Maghielse]]: Director of Programming & Audience. Manages the homepage producers, social media, SEO, dayparting; basically everything our newsroom calls “Programming”. Julia H’s most direct contact.
     ^5v5fvp

  
  

I’m sure I’ve left a lot of people off of this list (Suzanne in Legal, Jameel in People and Culture, Sue McWilliams and Peg Clancy, two of the best admins ever) but this will get you started. I also didn’t want to scare you away on day one. 

  

Regular Meetings

  

These meetings are what we currently have on the books. As you get more familiar with the team and their work, you may see opportunities to improve on this (or really, anything at all.) Know that we have very few load-bearing walls; remodel all you like. 

-   Leads Stand-up (M / W / F, 9:30 AM)
    

-   3x weekly standup for my leads. Monday we discuss our plans for the week, Wednesdays are to report out any blockers you’re finding, and Fridays are for highs and lows from the week. 
    

-   Stakeholder Sync (Thursday 11 AM)
    

-   Meet with key department leads to coordinate on major projects and unit-specific initiatives. Best example of real cross-departmental sharing and collaboration
    

-   Product Demo and Happy Hour (Bi-weekly Thursday at 4 PM) 
    

-   As each Sprint ends, PMs and Engineers show attendees from across the company what we’ve shipped and what is coming next
    

-   Inspiration Time (Bi-weekly Friday at 11 AM) 
    

-   Open to all in Product, Design, Engineering, and Analytics, this is a free-form forum to discuss interesting things folks encountered the two weeks prior. The goal is to investigate emergent ideas and anticipate their impacts on our business and our work. (I started this shortly after I arrived and it’s low-key one of my favorite things.) 
    

  

I’d also encourage you to check in with Mark on which Analytics team meetings would be best to participate in; a list of meetings appears on the “[team rituals](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/622977/Analytics+Team+Rituals+and+Calendar+Meetings+Rituals+Vacation+SOP)” page (also linked below). 

  

You will also have a weekly one-on-one scheduled with me to talk about any issues you may be facing, successes you’ve accomplished, or questions about your ongoing work. These meetings are informal and driven by your own agenda. Said another way, this is your time, and your needs will come first. 

  

After you get settled, you’ll want to start regular 1:1 meetings with your direct reports. When this happens I’ll scale back (but not eliminate) my own regular meetings with them.

  

Communication Tools

  

-   Confluence Space: [Analytics Team Knowledge Base](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/overview?homepageId=228555). There are other spaces you’ll be pulled into from time to time, but this is your home base.
    

-   Take particular notice of [Inquirer Data Strategy](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/229131/Inquirer+Data+Strategy). It’s not wrong, but definitely needs a review and a cleanup. It’s also very tactical. 
    
-   Mark can guide you through other places to review within Confluence: he and the team make extensive use of the tool. Examples: [Analytics Team SOP](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/228012/Analytics+Team+SOP), [Analytics Team Rituals](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/622977/Analytics+Team+Rituals+and+Calendar+Meetings+Rituals+Vacation+SOP), [Analytics Dashboards and Reports](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/228649/Analytics+Dashboards+Reports).
    

-   Slack Channels: The company’s Slack culture is skewed a bit toward DMs, which is something I’m working to change so that more conversations can be remotely overheard. Most of the channels below were extant when I joined, so some rationalization may be needed. You’ll end up in quite a few channels, but here are the ones we use most often as a team:
    

-   digi-data-social-club: A private room for the Product, Design, Engineering, and Analytics teams for casual conversation.
    
-   inspiration-time: channel for collecting and discussing ideas that we’ll review in our bi-weekly meeting.
    
-   analytics - public-facing channel for folks around the company to ask data questions
    
-   analytics-team-core - does what it says on the label.
    
-   engineering - where the developers hang out
    
-   product - public facing discussions of product features and requests
    
-   digital-bugs-and-feedback: for bugs and other issues with our reader-facing products. Use #support for internal system issues.
    
-   testing-optimization: for news on A/B tests starting or finishing, with results. 
    
-   tech-anomalies-meter: an example of a functional monitoring routine that checks in on performance of our reader meter. Anomalies alert the channel, though without much context. (For example, we “alerted” a sub-only article by email, so naturally, meter stops went up 5X. This channel started yelling a lot.) 
    

-   Other key documents
    

-   [2021 Strategic Plan and Goals](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16gUHLXUA-t4Py2DYOzVR98EgHOCNt4ZW/view) - this is being updated as I type for 2022. Gives an idea of what we were trying to accomplish last year, and how we were thinking about turning the company. A TON of progress was made this year, which we can discuss. 
    
-   [Metrics that Matter Project space](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/InqDS/pages/418120273/Metrics+that+Matter+project) - This is both one of our more important projects, and one that’s been languishing for nearly 18 months. This will be the first thing to help wrangle into shape and push out the door. 
     ^f86fxx
-   [Analytics team JIRA board](https://inquirer.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AI/boards/15?selectedIssue=AI-1064) - pretty self-explanatory; take a look at how things are working and get a feel for the team’s capabilities.
    

  

# 30 / 60 / 90-day Expectations

^6f005d

These goals are high-level, and I’m sure that as you get settled you’ll add to this list. Use this as a starting point for the next three months, both to be clear with me on what you’re working on, and to give yourself the leeway to go slow and take time to learn. While we all have big expectations, they’re not so big that you’re expected to solve things in your first few weeks. Enjoy this period and use it to your advantage. 

  

## Thirty days: 
-   Meet with each of your reports and with Mark’s analyst team to understand their roles, ambitions, and personal styles
-   Set up your 1:1 schedule with your reports
-   Attend the regular rituals of the Analytics team to get a sense of how we’re currently working 
-   Start to meet with the extended group of people listed above to establish those working relationships, beginning with Becky, Lydia, Pete, and Patrick 
-   Collect observations / suggestions for improvement 
-   Begin recruiting for open Data Engineering positions

## Sixty days: 
-   Establish your cadence of regular team meetings: lead some of the existing ones, create new ones, and cancel ones that aren’t needed any longer 
-   Complete your tour of Zoom coffees / lunches / hellos
-   Meet with Lisa to hear her priorities for how we build our data capabilities, what she’s excited about, and to share with her your perspectives on how The Inquirer can evolve
-   Develop an approach to completing and deploying the Metrics that Matter project (in terms of both tech and comms)
  

## Ninety days:
-   Update the onboarding document, list of links, etc. so that the next employee we hire benefits from your experiences
-   Identify process / tooling gaps or issues, and work with me to build a plan to improve 
-   Evaluate the skills and capabilities of the team, and as necessary, develop plans with me for improving performance
-   Establish a long-term roadmap for improving our data tech, with an eye toward how these capabilities will be communicated and deployed
