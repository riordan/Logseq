[NAME]:
I I really enjoyed our conversation earlier today. Thanks again for taking the time to chat.

I wanted to map out the rest of The Process so you know what's ahead with regard to our hiring for this position.

**Technical Exercise**
Attached to this email is a zip file with our Technical Exercise. Send it back to me within the week {DATE} either attached to an email or as a link to a private git repository. Let me know if something comes up and you are requesting more time.

You'll need Python3 and SQLite to run through it. It is NOT intended to be a comprehensive examination of your software engineering skills, but rather a quick exercise to see how you work with a few key approaches to data engineering. It should not take more than a few hours, so please don't overthink it; if something seems off, let us know as it could very well be an error on our part.

We'll review your response and let you know if you'll be proceeding to the next stage within a week.

**Panel Interviews**
After the technical screening exercise is our panel interviews. There are typically three interviews with various folks you'll be working with as representatives of data platform peers, collaborators and stakeholders, and department leadership. Each interview normally takes under an hour. You should also use these as conversations to learn more about us and see if we are the kind of organization and team that supports your professional needs and interests.

Depending on schedules and preferences, we try to book these interviews to occur over the course of a day or two and they are conducted remotely over Zoom. They are all conversational; there is no live-coding.

**Clear Decisions**

After the panel interviews, we'll gather feedback from each of your interviewers and will get back to you with a clear decision as to an offer within two weeks (ideally much sooner).

With that out of the way, I really look forward to chatting again. If anything else comes up or you've got any feedback, questions, or concerns please send them our way. You can reach out to me directly or "Nancy Nguyen" <nnguyen@inquirer.com> on our People and Culture team.

Best regards,
Dave Riordan
