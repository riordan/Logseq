# Briefing:
> ![[Inquirer Welcome Letter#^f86fxx]]

> **Decision:**  
> Identify the core metrics that convey the business health & strategic progress of our organization.
> 
> **Background:**
> 
> - The Inquirer has reached a **level of digital maturity** that **demands enhanced uses of metrics** as both **health indicators**, and **marker of progress** on our journey towards the digital future.
> - As is often the case whenever a new discipline takes root in an organization, we have experienced a **Cambrian Explosion of numbers and reports** originating from **different sources** and **different parts of the organization**.
> -  The time has come for us to both **simplify and enlarge**:  **Minimize the duplicative efforts** and **standardize** on a set of **Metrics that Matter** that will become our **single source of truth**.
# Suggested Approach
Break out into separate lanes:

| Focus Area                                     | Lifecycle                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Own company KPI Reporting                      | Production                            |
| Create & Own foundational datasets as products | Experimental, Operational, Production |
| Productize Analytics offerings                 | TEAM OPS                              | 
| Get data products discovered and used          | TEAM OPS                              |
