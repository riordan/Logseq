## Highlights
Political hobbyism on the left also stands in sharp contrast to the most successful recent political movements, which have been on the right—the right-to-life movement, the gun rights movement—which were developed around chapter-based, local organizations with thousands of volunteers willing to roll up their sleeves and, slowly and steadily, achieve modest political goals: taking over political party committees, quietly seeding judicial offices, recruiting state legislative candidates—activities that seem beneath the political hobbyist who is strictly infatuated with national political drama. — location: [116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=116) ^ref-49241

fiddling around in politics online and voraciously consuming news, have a long legacy. They are reminiscent of a well-documented phenomenon from the 1950s of “amateur Democrats” who formed local clubs in major US cities.11 These clubs, which were briefly popular in middle-class neighborhoods of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and other cities, were dominated by the cosmopolitan, professional class. — location: [121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=121) ^ref-33939

---
Officially, in their meetings, the clubs had an agenda: opposition to the insiders who controlled the Democratic Party as well as promotion of a liberal ideological worldview. But club meetings were often focused on debates of broad national concerns. In long nights at clubhouses or over snacks and coffee in living rooms, participants discussed grand political issues and hosted intellectuals as guest speakers.12 — location: [124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=124) ^ref-3354

At worst this is you: the appearance ot a seemingly related agenda, but in fact the "action" is talk.

---
What distinguished these clubs from the “regular” Democrats, who controlled levers of power in the Democratic Party at the time and who mobilized voters in working-class areas of these cities, were the motivations that brought them into politics. The regulars—political staffers and volunteers alike—sought recognition when they did a good job securing votes and organizing precincts. They sought power for their side. — location: [128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=128) ^ref-30647

The right motivation, which drives the right action, is gaining what power you can, then deploying it in service of delivering aligned results, which in turn can be used to incrementally build piecemeal control and use of power in a positive cycle of results. But it has to start with lots of little wins at the local never getting results for those who got you there, while equally demonstrating potential for future stakeholders you wish to put their trust in your movement.

---
Achieving this goal meant doing good in the eyes of the voters. To win the voters’ favor, they delivered on issues that their voters cared about. But to these party regulars, policy issues were secondary to winning and holding power. — location: [131](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=131) ^ref-61116

---
what inspired the participation of rank-and-file amateurs was a social scene where they could argue about principles. They saw themselves as worldly in comparison to the working-class party regulars; the amateurs cared about the big important ideas, not fixing potholes and helping neighbors. — location: [133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=133) ^ref-4155

Obsession with ideas of perfection and only the ideas

---
Whereas party regulars employed long-term precinct captains who took pride in knowing their neighborhoods, the amateur clubs, composed of younger professionals, had trouble sustaining active volunteers for more than a year or two. The lawyers and doctors and other professionals had a distaste for the parochial. They didn’t have the time to organize city and suburban blocks. What they made time for was arguing into the night about the issues. — location: [135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=135) ^ref-16263

Real wins + long term relationships &gt; “innovation”

“The principal motivation for many of these people [i.e., active members and leaders] is the sheer fascination with politics.” — location: [143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=143) ^ref-63686

trying to get involved in his local Republican committee. Apparently, the first thing he decided to do was to transcribe the state Republican Party’s platform into Microsoft Excel. Each sentence he put on a different row in the spreadsheet. On each line, he made a check mark if the sentence abided by conservative principles, according to him. On his phone call, this man was obsessed with the degree to which the state Republican Party was Republican in Name Only (RINO) or truly conservative. For a fortysomething-year-old dad, he had an oddly Holden Caulfield grade of disdain for the hypocrites in charge. He didn’t seem to think much about what could win votes. He was just dreamily concerned with being authentically conservative. Such a desire to focus on ideology rather than on acquiring power was common among the Democratic clubs. — location: [148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=148) ^ref-10829

---
the professional class involved in the clubs tended to believe that if all voters thought through the issues as deeply as they did, their side would eventually win. — location: [154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=154) ^ref-41476

---
The party regulars, on the other hand, who interacted daily with working-class voters, saw this view as naïve. The typical voter does not wish to think through public policy. The best thing to do is convince them, through actions, that Democrats care about them. Show voters you care, serve them, empathize with their day-to-day concerns. They will connect your expressions of concern with the Democratic brand. — location: [155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=155) ^ref-44442

Know your constituents personally and do things for they that result in better lives (in some way). They they'll  trust your "big ideas"

Think [[Rishi Kumar]] and his [[InFo]] [[Efficiency Hacks]]: give people things that actually make their lives better and that they __will use__ and they’ll back you on the bigger stuff in the future. Your things don’t always have to be perfectly aligned with the “grand ideology master plan” (or even in it) to build that relationship resulting in power, though that alignment can help. But if it gets in the way of delivering things that build trust and relationships then it might need to be jettisoned (in this particular delivery vehicle).

---
friends who aren’t involved beyond news-following believe that their political positions are self-evidently correct. They don’t volunteer in politics because if they have to convince anyone of their ideas, that means the ideas aren’t self-evidently correct. So the friends don’t want to struggle to move politics toward what they think is right because they think they shouldn’t have to. It’s a strange, utterly doomed logic, — location: [160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=160) ^ref-24914

---
Today’s hobbyists possess the negative qualities of the amateurs—hyperemotional engagement, obsession with national politics, an insatiable appetite for debate—and none of the amateur’s positive qualities—the neighborhood meetings, the concrete goals, the leadership. — location: [164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=164) ^ref-25831

---
Yet, citizens who want to empower their political values would be better off if they spent less time consuming politics as at-home amateurs and instead fell in line to help strengthen organizations and leaders. — location: [167](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=167) ^ref-44647

Move organizational goals

Rather than kibitzing with their social media friends, they could adopt some of the spirit of the party regulars, counting votes and building interpersonal relationships in their neighborhoods. — location: [168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=168) ^ref-53475

Move beyond "your regulars”. Time with “your regulars" should be about equipping them (and you all equipping each other) to know and develop relationships with mechanisms for delivering the results of power or simply developing relationships to deliver those results of power.

---
But when we look at the actions that constitute their political activity and, as important, the actions they are not taking, we have no choice but to face the truth that what they are doing is motivated by their emotional needs and a pursuit of personal gratification rather than a deeper commitment to the common good. — location: [187](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=187) ^ref-9092

Wonk shit

I hope I can show you the redemption of politics as a service to others, a form of politics where participants get power to improve their communities, present and future. — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=193) ^ref-23020

Learning about the power-seeking behavior of these people will shed light on some surprising, and perhaps uncomfortable, changes we ought to make to improve our democracy, namely by redirecting our political energy toward serving the material and emotional needs of our neighbors. — location: [197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=197) ^ref-29649

Much of the time we spend on politics is best described as an inward-focused leisure activity for people who like politics. — location: [212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=212) ^ref-4224

The same could for be said for your time at work.

Obsessively checking the news, for instance, can be neurotic, anxiety-inducing behavior. True, sports fanatics also agonize as they soak up endless minutiae of sports, but in politics the day-to-day minutiae seem much more important. — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=214) ^ref-31344

Slack and constant "absorbtion" vs actual learning + teaching

Even when we insist that we have higher motivations, our actions often betray a shallower basis for political engagement — location: [217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=217) ^ref-39717

---
Actions matter more than motivations, but thinking critically about our motivations helps us determine how much of our political activity is even meant to be a service to others and how much is meant to be a service to ourselves. — location: [222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=222) ^ref-47419

News choices used to be quite limited, especially on television. During the broadcast-TV era, the Federal Communications Commission required the few channels to show some kind of educational content for an hour between 7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. The major networks all satisfied this requirement by producing an evening news program. Up until 1987, broadcasters also needed to present politics in an ideologically balanced way, under a policy called the fairness doctrine.1 In this environment with just a few TV channels, lots of people, including those who did not particularly care for politics, ended up watching news. The news they watched was evenhanded, in recognition of the fairness doctrine and that the audience for the news program was ideologically broad-based.2 In hindsight, it seems peculiar that in the broadcast-TV era many people who didn’t care for politics at all ended up watching the nightly news. In fact, they just liked watching TV more than they didn’t like politics, and news was the only thing on.3 — location: [243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=243) ^ref-52281

remember: government regulation created the the u network nightly news format, and for the first time in contemporary history non elites consumed political news at an unprecedented dent-l rate and it still allowed the John birch society to flourish

Once cable was introduced, and with each subsequent technology, the choice set expanded. Consumers who do not like politics can watch something else. The producers of political content no longer have an interest or a legal obligation to appeal broadly. Instead they want to capture a dedicated following of viewers who will seek out political news obsessively. — location: [252](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=252) ^ref-29128

Ben Thompson has had good whole argument based on the behavior of audiences self separating before from the cable news Vs broadcast era. But prior to that the news was effectively forced down their throats and look what happened: the new deal and Great society programs. There’s been nothing like either at the federal level extending entitlement at the federal level since then. So maybe is all really closely related,

Cable news offers little investigative journalism, but the anchors put on an act that they are taking viewers on deep dives, behind the scenes, into the weeds. Rachel Maddow, for instance, will report information such as the prison identification numbers of convicted members of President Trump’s inner circle (Trump adviser Paul Manafort is three-five-two-zero-seven-dash-zero-one-six; Trump lawyer Michael Cohen is eight-six-zero-six-seven-dash-zero-five-four),6 information that is neither hard to find nor in any way useful to viewers. Reading numbers out loud, though, seems authoritative. — location: [261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=261) ^ref-61463

Of Bush, former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann fumed, “You’re a fascist! Get them to print you a T-shirt with FASCIST on it! … You, sir, have no place in a government of the people, by the people, for the people.”7 Some of us find these rants cathartic. — location: [268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=268) ^ref-42796

Maybe bush want an autocratic dictator but good economic and social policies dismantled the social contract so far that it accelerated the takeover and that Barack Obama deeply squandered the last real chance to build a progressive majority huffing the fumes of bipartisanship and subtle, unperceptible nudge.

Could this also explain the gerontocracy we are currently living through. The generation that first took power of their earliest boomer have remained politically polarized through the media their entire lives and thus were primed for this moment

newspaper columns at three points in time: 1955, 1975, and 2009. In the first two periods, they found that columnists basically never resorted to name-calling and belittling. But suddenly, in their 2009 data, popular writers such as Charles Krauthammer and Maureen Dowd had emerged who regularly used this language. — location: [286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=286) ^ref-12028

In 2016, one in four Americans visited a fake news website, as discovered by a team of researchers who asked a sample of Americans to install software on their computers that tracked what websites they visited.13 The researchers found that participants who were most interested in and most knowledgeable about politics consumed fake news the most. These people weren’t easily duped by the lies of fake news stories. They were sophisticated consumers who sought the fake stories because they are junkies. After already reading through the comparatively tame world of real news, they wanted to up their dosage, and so they went for fantasies. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07TD6FVHG&location=289) ^ref-2794
