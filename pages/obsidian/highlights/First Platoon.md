## Highlights
“We patrolled hard, knowing we were walking into a minefield every day,” remembered Captain Swanson. “From a counterterrorism perspective, we were grasping at straws. We were on a beat, like local cops.” Except they were not police officers, they were soldiers, which made what they were doing less like law enforcement and more like martial law. — location: [184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08JKPCQLD&location=184) ^ref-48020

Sectioning off an area, registering inhabitants, limiting their freedom of movement, and enforcing compliance with threat of detainment or imprisonment but under the guise of the rule of law is reminiscent of a draconian system of control implemented across Europe in the Middle Ages to fight bubonic plague. — location: [188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08JKPCQLD&location=188) ^ref-54196

In order to impose the rule of law, the government ordered the full-scale cataloging of people. A medieval version of biometrics-enabled intelligence. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08JKPCQLD&location=198) ^ref-63610

Every day, twice a day, every member of each family was required to put his or her face in the front window of their home as a designated sentry passed by. “All the information gathered through the twice-daily visits,” writes Foucault, was then “collated with the central register held by the deputy mayors in the town’s central administration . . . in a kind of pyramid of uninterrupted power.” What this meant was that the location of each individual was to be constantly known to the state, “observed at every point . . . [his] slightest movements are supervised . . . all events are recorded [to include] death, illness, complaints, irregularities.” — location: [205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08JKPCQLD&location=205) ^ref-3462
