## Highlights
basic research has the potential of having multiple uses, contributing to a large number of areas. Because of the multiuse nature of most basic research, as well as the long time lags between discovery and application, it unlikely that any one individual, company, or industry would support a sufficient amount of basic research to advance innovation at the desired pace. — location: [154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006Y94BFG&location=154) ^ref-23094

Spillovers are great for growth, but they do not induce market-based institutions to conduct considerable amounts of upstream research. — location: [157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006Y94BFG&location=157) ^ref-53043

---
Much of the research of universities and public research institutions cannot instantly be transformed into new products and processes. It can take time, as the examples of atomic clocks and hybrid corn clearly show. — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006Y94BFG&location=179) ^ref-18774

The World Wide Web had a huge impact almost from its inception. The discovery of giant magnetoresistance transformed disk storage in a matter of years. There are also false hopes. Research that looks promising can fail to deliver on the predicted timeline. The discovery of the cystic fibrosis gene in 1989 brought the hope for gene-based treatments. To date, the "payoff remains just around the corner."49 — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006Y94BFG&location=180) ^ref-28691

science as a proess / infrastructure story

When scientists were asked to score the importance of a number of job factors, they consistently gave the highest scores to intellectual challenge and independence. Not only do they see challenge as a key motivation for doing science, they also see the intellectual challenge as a reward. — location: [286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006Y94BFG&location=286) ^ref-35188

doing hard things because they are hard intellectually, not because of brokeenen process . basic flow state. publishing should bee easy becauzse its not important ton solving the puzzle. discoveryh of data should be easy because its critiical to olving the puzzlee an you shjuld  bee s able too get baack to thss solvin of it sooner

Recognition is key in science, not only as an end in itself but also as a means for acquiring the resources to continue to engage in puzzle-solving activity. Here the focus is on recognition as an end in itself. — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006Y94BFG&location=294) ^ref-9478
