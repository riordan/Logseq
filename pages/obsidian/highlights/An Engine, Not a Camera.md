the process of clearing is undertaken. Those whose trading positions have lost money must transfer cash or collateral to the exchange's clearinghouse for deposit into the accounts of those whose positions have gained.

Finance as a liberal art?

Many economists did not see financial economics as central to their discipline, viewing it as specialized and relatively unimportant in almost the same way as the economics of ketchup, studied in isolation, would be trivial.

Typically, those assumptions involve matters such as the following: that stocks and other financial assets can be bought and sold at prevailing market prices without affecting those prices, that no commissions or other "transaction costs" are incurred in so doing, that stocks can be "sold short" (e.g., borrowed and sold, and later repurchased and returned) freely and without… — location: [167](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RDE06S&location=167) ^ref-18184

"performativity," in which the use of a model (or some other aspect of economics) makes it "more true," raises the possibility of its converse: that the effect of the practical use of a theory or model may be to alter economic processes so that they conform less well to the theory or model. — location: [308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RDE06S&location=308) ^ref-40514

strongest senses of "performativity" are subsets of a more general phenomenon: the incorporation of economics into the infrastructures of markets. — location: [314](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RDE06S&location=314) ^ref-34414

---
beliefs about markets are clearly important, an aspect of economics that is incorporated only into beliefs "in the heads" of economic actors may have a precarious status. A form of incorporation that is in some senses deeper is incorporation into algorithms, procedures, routines, and material devices.38 An economic model that is incorporated into these can have effects even if those who use them are skeptical of the model's virtues, unaware of its details, or even ignorant of its very existence. — location: [315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RDE06S&location=315) ^ref-2099
