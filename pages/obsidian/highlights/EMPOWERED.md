## Highlights
they will receive a much greater return from a significantly smaller number of the right employees. Employees who are given business and customer problems to solve and are held accountable to the results. — location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=866) ^ref-41552

---
Also, it is important to realize that the core CIO job (managing the IT function) is both important and difficult. But here's the problem: the CIO truly is there to serve the business. — location: [876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=876) ^ref-41141

---
we look to leadership for inspiration and we look to management for execution. — location: [909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=909) ^ref-23094

---
The purpose of strong leadership is to inspire and motivate the organization. — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=914) ^ref-11576

---
If product teams are to be empowered to make good decisions, they need to have the strategic context necessary to make those decisions. — location: [915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=915) ^ref-24805

---
If we want teams of missionaries, it's essential that every person in the organization understands and is convinced—they need to be true believers. This requires an ongoing crusade of evangelizing—in recruiting, onboarding, weekly 1:1 coaching, all‐hands meetings, team lunches, and everything in between. — location: [946](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=946) ^ref-9199

---
every member of a product team deserves to have someone who is committed to helping them get better at their craft. — location: [989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=989) ^ref-26470

---
Specifically, they don't believe they have the level of people on their teams they need to truly empower them. So, along with the other key business leaders from across the company, they believe they need to very explicitly direct the teams themselves. This is also known as the “command‐and‐control” model of management. — location: [1019](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1019) ^ref-28203

---
What does it mean to think like a product person? It means focusing on outcome. Considering all of the risks—value, usability, feasibility, and business viability. Thinking holistically about all dimensions of the business and the product. Anticipating ethical considerations or impacts. Creative problem solving. Persistence in the face of obstacles. Leveraging engineering and the art of the possible. Leveraging design and the power of user experience. Leveraging data to learn and to make a compelling argument. — location: [1756](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1756) ^ref-56308

---
Just to be perfectly clear here, at the performance review, nothing should be a surprise—everything should have already been discussed in depth, likely for months. — location: [1809](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1809) ^ref-40005

---
Someone who needs to be told what to do every day is not cut out for the product person role. — location: [1829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1829) ^ref-4821

---
The idea is to anticipate the different concerns and objections that might come from key executives and stakeholders, take the time to consider and write up clear answers to these objections, and then review these responses with the people that have these concerns. — location: [1885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1885) ^ref-43393

---
an important mindset for a product person, which is the difference between thinking like an owner versus thinking like an employee. — location: [1997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1997) ^ref-51683

---
most owners act like missionaries, not all missionaries act like owners. — location: [2020](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2020) ^ref-28964

---
If I had to boil it all down, I'd say that thinking like an owner versus thinking like an employee is primarily about taking responsibility for the outcome rather than just the activities. — location: [2064](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2064) ^ref-36447

---
the single most common objection I hear is an unwillingness to take responsibility for outcomes (and the pressure that implies). — location: [2067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2067) ^ref-12015

---
to get the critically important work of a product manager done, you need on the order of four solid hours a day. — location: [2105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2105) ^ref-25534

---
quality time working on coming up with solutions to the difficult problems we're trying to solve—otherwise known as product discovery. — location: [2109](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2109) ^ref-50645

---
Your highest‐order contribution and responsibility as product manager is to make sure that what the engineers are asked to build will be worth building. That it will deliver the necessary results. This means working with designers and engineers to come up with solutions that are valuable, usable, feasible, and viable. That is product discovery, and that is what takes on the order of four solid hours a day. — location: [2129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2129) ^ref-46789

---
if you can't manage to clear four hours a day during your workday, then I only know of two possibilities: either you extend your workday, or you fail to deliver results and so you fail at your job. — location: [2139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2139) ^ref-44545

And that was the real problem

---
recognize that acquiring knowledge and applying knowledge are two different things. — location: [2175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2175) ^ref-32948

---
when your product team has remote employees, this collaboration often suffers, so your coaching of collaboration needs to increase for your remote workers. — location: [2214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2214) ^ref-59797

---
three critical characteristics of strong product teams, no matter what processes they use: the first is tackling risks early; the second is solving problems collaboratively; and the third is being accountable to results. — location: [2216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2216) ^ref-28816

---
collaboration is not about artifacts. — location: [2227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2227) ^ref-43310

---
sometimes we need to create artifacts (especially when team members are remote), but that is certainly not how we collaborate. In fact, these artifacts more often get in the way of actual collaboration. — location: [2229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2229) ^ref-15629

---
in an empowered product team, the purpose of the product team is “to serve the customers in ways customers love, yet work for the business.” — location: [2309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2309) ^ref-16934

---
Our job is to find a solution that works for customers and for the various parts of the business. — location: [2311](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2311) ^ref-15587

---
The product manager is not there to “gather requirements” from stakeholders, but the product manager is also not there to dictate solutions to stakeholders. — location: [2315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2315) ^ref-37391

---
Modern product work is all about relationships. This is particularly true for product managers. — location: [2332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2332) ^ref-33572

---
PMs sometimes need coaching to realize that trust is most easily built if you do it before you need it. This requires deliberate effort. Try this exercise: Have the PM write down the list of people with whom she regularly collaborates. Add to the list any stakeholders whose input she regularly needs. Next, circle the three to five names that are most important to her having a successful outcome in her work. Finally, circle the names of the one or two people she most dreads having to deal with. Congratulations! You've identified the list of relationships in which this PM needs to invest. — location: [2338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2338) ^ref-35125

---
But I interpret this signal very differently. It is my mind warning me of the consequences if I don't do my homework and truly prepare. The fear of looking clueless is what keeps me up late preparing, studying, thinking, writing, rehearsing, and iterating. Most important, the fear of looking clueless is also what pushes me to try out my article/talk/presentation beforehand on some people that I highly respect and I know will tell me honestly if I am not solid in my thinking or my delivery. — location: [2372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2372) ^ref-63533
