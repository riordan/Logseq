## Highlights
The totalizing, scientific secrecy that the atomic bomb appeared to demand was new, unusual, and very nearly unprecedented. It was foreign to both American science and American democracy, and its compatibility with either has always been an area of dispute. But the circumstances of the bomb’s creation, and the bomb itself, seemed to mandate the period of secrecy be extended, to avoid an existential risk. — location: [123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=123) ^ref-54239

We now find ourselves over seven decades after the end of World War II, and some three decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and nuclear weapons, nuclear secrecy, and nuclear fears show every appearance of being a permanent part of our present world, to the degree that for most it is nearly impossible to imagine it otherwise. — location: [126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=126) ^ref-60532

---
while the United States may have been the first country to make an atomic bomb, it was also the first country to release a technical history of the atomic bomb, only days after its first use, and it did so in the interest of both improving democratic discourse and preserving further secrecy. That such a document could be created at all, rendering into plain and unified discussion the work of the Manhattan Project that had been previously enshrouded with code words and a “need to know” compartmentalization, is strange enough by itself, and no other country has done anything similar since. But that the top scientific, military, and political representatives on the project would all agree to its utility, and lobby to the President personally for its release only days after the Nagasaki attack, is a remarkable example of the ways in which secrecy and revelation are not only paired, but can serve many different ideologies and institutional goals. — location: [147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=147) ^ref-39451

What can this tell us about how temporary and expedient projects in business become institutionalized and routinized?

This “Cold War regime” simultaneously held that to release an atomic secret inappropriately was to suffer consequences as extreme as death, but that once atomic information had been deemed safe (and perhaps, profitable), it ought to be distributed as widely as possible. — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=204) ^ref-7978

Oh so just like corporate AI research. Thats a genuinely comparable predecessor.

---
Many of these were problems of its own making: embodying both the extremes of constraint and release, the Cold War approach to nuclear secrecy fundamentally rested on the dubious assertion that the technology it governed could be divided into simple categories of safety and danger, despite its inherently dual-use nature. — location: [207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=207) ^ref-15397

It is worth noting that while much about the history of US nuclear weapons is still secret, there is an impressive amount that is not. The same forces that created the aforementioned tensions around nuclear secrecy have resulted in a system that, over sometimes very long periods of time, results in a lot of information being eventually released. This is often the case for documents that are not about the weapons, per se, but are about the governance of the weapons. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=218) ^ref-46701

and so the question becomes, is the information that I care about also information that the censor thinks should be censored? In some cases yes, but in many cases no. — location: [253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=253) ^ref-35737

---
Leslie Groves, the Army General who had presided over the Manhattan Project, lamented to a secret congressional committee about the impossibility of controlling the dangerous weapons that were steadily emerging: “I am afraid the scientists have led us into a terrible world. I can’t figure out how we can keep the knowledge from spreading, except to have a complete iron curtain.”12 — location: [283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=283) ^ref-7453

The history of nuclear secrecy in the United States is one about the troublesome quandary raised by fears of dangerous knowledge in a nation where information is anything but easy to control. — location: [287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=287) ^ref-42364

---
This original secrecy was practiced as self-censorship, in which scientists abstained (or didn’t, as it turned out) from publishing on topics that they judged “sensitive.” But this morphed, surprisingly quickly, into a system of government control over scientific publication, and from there into government control over nearly all information relating to atomic research. When the nuclear physicists initiated their call for secrecy, they thought it would be temporary, and controlled by them. They were wrong. — location: [304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=304) ^ref-37648

the uranium nucleus had not grown from the neutron, as Fermi had thought, but had split into two pieces. They called the phenomena “fission.”4 This was physically interesting, and scientifically surprising, but not necessarily scary. The jump from “fission is possible” to “a nuclear weapon is possible” is a very large one. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=322) ^ref-15769

On the day in April 1933 when he decided to flee from Berlin to Vienna, the train he took was essentially empty. One day later, the same train was overcrowded and stopped at the border, and everyone on it was interrogated. Szilard later related the impact this had on his thinking: “This just goes to show that if you want to succeed in this world you don’t have to be much cleverer than other people, you just have to be one day earlier than most people. This is all that it takes.”6 — location: [333](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=333) ^ref-57923

---
Szilard didn’t know of a nuclear reaction that could create such a chain of neutrons, and neither did anyone else in 1933. Szilard did not let that stop his thinking. He instead thought about what he would be able to do if he did have such a reaction. By 1934, Szilard had written up a rough outline of how such a process might work, with an early concept of a “critical mass” (the amount of the reacting material you would need for the reaction to become self-sustaining) and the properties of the chain reaction. In order to attract official attention for his work, and also implement some control over it, he filed for a patent with the British, assigned it to the British Admiralty, and urged that it be kept secret. This act was arguably the very first instance of nuclear secrecy—even before fission was discovered and atomic bombs were technically possible. — location: [357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=357) ^ref-40697

---
All of this was very audacious on the part of Szilard: he didn’t actually have an invention, just an idea that relied on a yet-undiscovered physical process. And his first approach was to make it both proprietary and secret, neither of which are compatible with the more idealistic ethos of science. The British physicists whom Szilard wrote to about this idea must have found him eccentric, even fringe. When Szilard tried to sell Rutherford on the idea, he had him thrown out of his office, offended by both Szilard’s speculative, dilettantish approach to nuclear physics, as well as his move to try to patent it. — location: [364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=364) ^ref-3325

---
Nuclear fission was initiated by a neutron, but did it create more neutrons as a result, so-called secondary neutrons? The Hahn-Meitner papers did not mention such a possibility. But Szilard was primed to look for the neutrons, not necessarily because he was more clever, but because he was, once again, a day ahead of the crowd. Overnight, his ideas about chain reactions went from science fiction to possibility, if, and only if, secondary neutrons existed. And in this realization, at this crucial moment, his mind once again turned to secrecy. As he recalled later: “I thought that if neutrons are in fact emitted in fission, this fact should be kept secret from the Germans.”14 Because nothing could be worse to a European, Jewish-descent refugee than the idea of nuclear-armed Nazis, and if in this new discovery of science was indeed a new weapon, then he wanted it to be controlled. It was in these urgent fears, mingled with science fiction and a new physical discovery, that the first collective attempt for nuclear secrecy emerged. — location: [378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=378) ^ref-17911

By the early twentieth century, scientists and especially spokesmen of science tended to see their profession as being defined in part by open, international communication. But the true relationship between science and secrecy has not actually been so clean cut, as historians and sociologists of science have repeatedly found. Scientists have long practiced secrecy for a variety of reasons, including fear of losing priority, fear of political or religious reprisals, and fear of military misuse. The scientists who did these things were not cranks: among those who have used secrecy to their advantage are such luminaries as Galileo, Newton, and Darwin. — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=401) ^ref-15330

---
In the Industrial Age, scientific knowledge was often regarded as proprietary (even if such a concept impinged on the “purity” of science), and by the time of the First World War, science was associated with possibly dangerous, and thus secret, military knowledge. Merton’s and Bernal’s pronouncements about science described hypothetical ideals more than literal realities. But even in fields with no commercial, state, or military connections, practitioners of science have long limited how and when they disseminated information for professional reasons, like priority.17 — location: [406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=406) ^ref-18727

---
Secrecy was viewed as both antithetical to scientific advancement (it would hinder scientific progress) and potentially an existential threat to the scientific enterprise itself. This view is still common today amongst practicing scientists, even when dealing with potentially lethal technologies. — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=412) ^ref-28323

---
Physicists of the 1930s who attempted to control their work tended to do so not with secrecy, but with patents. Patents had their own negative associations with industry and profiteering, but academic physicists had found a way around this by assigning them to a neutral, non-profit organization like the Research Corporation, set up for this purpose in 1912. Any commercial royalties would then be channeled into further research, allowing all scientists to benefit. This approach was part idealism, part pragmatism: the idealism argued for a “purity” of academic science, while the pragmatism argued for advancing the careers of the scientists through credit and reinvestment of funds.18 — location: [415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=415) ^ref-30980

---
Fermi was already planning experiments to find out how many secondary neutrons were produced from fission, if any. If the number of secondary neutrons produced by fission reactions, on average, was more than one, then a powerful chain reaction was possible. If not, then then the whole thing was still just “moonshine.” Szilard suggested, in the name of self-preservation, that Fermi agree not to publish his results. Fermi was indignant; Szilard was asking to withhold research on the most cutting-edge work in his field, work directly derived from Fermi’s own Nobel Prize–winning research, on the basis that it could potentially be used for ill by the Nazis for a weapon inspired by science fiction. — location: [430](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=430) ^ref-20332

From the perspective of early 1939, Fermi had the facts on his side. — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=438) ^ref-6832

---
Fermi’s refusal frustrated Szilard, but at least he worked only down the hall, so Szilard would know what he was doing and planning. — location: [442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=442) ^ref-17730

---
Hitler was invading Czechoslovakia. Szilard’s argument for self-censorship was taking on more weight. The Columbia physicists met again and a compromise was reached: they would adopt a form of secrecy. Any new papers on fission would be sent to the Physical Review, who would register having received it. These registrations could, perhaps, be used to arbitrate later priority disputes. But the papers themselves would remain unpublished until a later date. — location: [464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=464) ^ref-29677

---
It was a scheme that, ideally, would satisfy the need for priority without making the work immediately public.25 Even though this was only a temporary approach, it was the first proposed system of nuclear secrecy, however small-scale and tentative. It was a procedure, but not yet a regime: it was still fairly ad hoc, and there were no real consequences for violating it. — location: [467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=467) ^ref-20075

Nuclear security started off as a scholars incentive hack

It was Szilard who was asking for something extraordinary: a belief that the normal procedures of science should be halted because of a fear that still easily seemed a decade of research away. — location: [477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=477) ^ref-41606

---
Lastly, the Columbia team contacted the heads of American scientific laboratories doing research in related fields to let them know of the new self-censorship scheme. The Physical Review agreed to the scheme: not only would they place holds on any fission publications that came across their desks, they would also tell the Columbia physicists who was submitting them. — location: [493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=493) ^ref-46038

while the physicists’ suspicion of secrecy would not totally abate, they would quickly become accustomed to working within a secrecy regime. — location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=533) ^ref-7315

That the US was woefully unprepared to mobilize technology for its own military purposes at the time played a role in this sudden fear of technical knowledge. At the late time it joined World War I, the US Army lacked gas masks, offensive chemicals, and the expertise needed to train troops to adapt to the new weapon. — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=616) ^ref-25255

---
This was in spite of the Wilson administration’s urgent attempts a few years earlier to mobilize the National Academy of Sciences to bring scientists and technical knowledge into better contact with military institutions. Scientists would eventually answer the call, but it was a disordered and not entirely successful collaboration. Several of the young scientists involved in this effort would, in a few decades, play key roles in the organization of government support of science for defense as a new World War loomed, drawing upon the disorganized experiences of their youth as a motivating force.45 — location: [618](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=618) ^ref-7491

Under a very narrow reading of the Espionage Act, any scientific secrets, such as those involved in chemical weapon development, would be secret largely because they were developed in a government facility, not for their inherent danger. — location: [633](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=633) ^ref-11228

---
Prior to the Second World War, the relationship between the United States government and the development of science and technology, even for military applications, was generally ad hoc, unenthusiastically pursued, and not well coordinated. A relationship existed, but it was not a deep one. While the value of technology to American industry was unquestioned, the role of basic science was more uncertain, and the US did not begin to approach the scientific stature of Europe until well into the twentieth century, aided, in part, by the “brain drain” of refugees from Europe in the 1930s. — location: [675](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=675) ^ref-18465

Even the very mundane aspects of secrecy—like using “SECRET” stamps, required organization. C. P. Baker, a physicist at Cornell, after laboriously hand-marking “SECRET” on every page of a lengthy report in the spring of 1942, left a plea on the its final page: “WE NEED A STAMP.”83 — location: [817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=817) ^ref-25213

Making secrecy real, Bush was finding, required entertaining some radical ideas—even the possibility of bringing scientists into the work just to keep them controlled. But merely telling scientists the work was secret was not enough. They needed to be taught how to treat secret documents, and OSRD struggled to do this through circulation of specific rules about what each classification “grade” meant in practical terms.86 In a number of cases it meant chastising violators until they exhibited a “security mindset.” In — location: [833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=833) ^ref-26169

Secrecy, Bush and Conant were finding, was no easy thing, and it relied as much on trying to control those inside the secrecy regime as it did on controlling what kind of information circulated outside of it. — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=840) ^ref-42003

---
“Preservation of secrecy on this matter is unusually difficult,” he explained, because of the amount of information and speculation already in the public domain before it came under government control. To encourage new, secret information staying secret, they had begun to “subdivide” the work, so that “full information is not given to every worker”—a technique that would be better known as compartmentalization, or the “need to know” principle. — location: [857](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=857) ^ref-10630

---
the matter was “under control to a reasonable extent,” but was “more vulnerable to espionage than is desirable.” The work should, he concluded, “be placed under rigid Army control as soon as actual production is embarked upon.”89 In a typically brief reply, Roosevelt urged Bush to move from the pilot phase to the production phase. On the matter of turning it over to the Army, Roosevelt had only one requirement: “I have no objection to turning over future progress to the War Department on condition that you yourself are certain that the War Department has made all adequate provision for absolute secrecy.”90 — location: [860](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=860) ^ref-22353

---
The normal explanation for the unusual level of secrecy is the bomb’s existential character. That is, the bomb is “special” because it poses problems that threaten the very existence of states and the nature of international order. — location: [873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=873) ^ref-39644

---
Keeping the bomb secret from people who doubted the wisdom of spending thousands of millions of dollars on physics projects may have been more important to the success of the Manhattan Project than keeping the bomb secret from the Germans. A Nazi atomic effort did not have the power to stop the American work in its tracks—only Congress could do that. — location: [899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=899) ^ref-61966

---
Turning this desire for control into action is where the scientists repeatedly stumbled. It is one thing to say that you don’t want the Nazis to know something, but how do you make it so? The practice of self-censorship was a weak one, because they could not enforce it effectively: there were no consequences for breaking it. Weak practices, coupled with relatively weak institutions (like scientific journals, which have no strong powers to regulate people), resulted in a non-functional secrecy regime, or at least one that was easily cracked. Only once they got serious about the institutionalization of secrecy did it begin to function, and that involved bringing in the big guns, literally. Government agencies, partnering with the military, and applying mindsets very different than those the scientists were accustomed to working with, would add “teeth” to this secrecy, at the cost of the autonomy of the scientists. — location: [976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=976) ^ref-30627

---
Practices were being put into place, one by one: document control (“SECRET” stamps), obfuscation (code-names), misinformation (to the press), compartmentalization (“need to know” policies), personnel discrimination (clearances and background checks), site-isolation (secret laboratories), physical security (barbed wire and guards), publication censorship (initially voluntary, later not), and oaths of secrecy (both psychological and legal in their intent) had all come into place. None of the individual elements were unique to the bomb, though in other OSRD programs, they had been implemented with less fanfare. — location: [984](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=984) ^ref-603

---
But at the heart of the matter, it was a cumulative series of half-steps that led to the secrecy of the Manhattan Project, and practically every policy embraced, and amplified, by the military had already been put in place by civilian scientists before they arrived, inspired by their fears. — location: [1003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1003) ^ref-42075

They were trying to keep the secret not merely from the Axis powers, but also from all US allies except the United Kingdom, as well as the national and international presses, the American Congress, and, to various degrees, nearly everyone who was working on the project itself, whose “need to know” extended only as far as necessary to do their direct jobs. Even maintaining such a secret for a relatively short amount of time—under three years—was a gargantuan task. — location: [1015](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1015) ^ref-2991

---
Though it would be celebrated as “the best-kept secret of war,” this mandate was in fact impossible: the effort to make the atomic bomb, on the time-scale required, meant that “absolute secrecy” could never be achieved in practice. — location: [1018](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1018) ^ref-36496

At its helm would be a notoriously gruff, undiplomatic, and relentless Army Colonel who had helped Marshall organize the early work: Leslie R. Groves. Of all the figures responsible for the successful wartime development of the atomic bomb, none perhaps can take as much credit as Groves. An engineer by training, he was not enthusiastic about taking on the assignment, as its chances of success were hardly guaranteed, and it was far from the front lines. But once he accepted the job, he was going to push it to completion. For the next three years, he dedicated every ounce of his will toward making the atomic bomb a reality in time for it to play some role in the war. His only precondition was that he be promoted to brigadier general first in order to better enforce his orders, especially with the “many academic scientists involved in the project,” who he thought would be reluctant to take orders from a mere colonel. — location: [1035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1035) ^ref-20105

---
He charted out a program to scale up the project by securing uranium stocks and obtaining a top military priority rating that would allow him to push his project even in the face of opposition from other Army generals as he began to siphon off scarce resources, human and material, into a project whose goals were known to only a select few.4 — location: [1042](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1042) ^ref-61118

The massive factories to produce the fissile materials that would fuel the weapon were purposefully isolated from surrounding communities, in part for public safety, but largely to ensure security. — location: [1067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1067) ^ref-28110

---
Groves made it clear that to him, not only was compartmentalization key to secrecy, but also it was a tool to control scientific personnel: Compartmentalization of knowledge, to me, was the very heart of security. My rule was simple and not capable of misinterpretation—each man should know everything he needed to know to do his job and nothing else. Adherence to this rule not only provided an adequate measure of security, but it greatly improved over-all efficiency by making our people stick to their knitting. And it made quite clear to all concerned that the project existed to produce a specific end product—not to enable individuals to satisfy their curiosity and to increase their scientific knowledge.12 — location: [1087](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1087) ^ref-42455

This is the most Apple shit

---
At each of the major project sites, compartmentalization operated somewhat differently, because of the different character of the work done at each location. At industrial production sites, like Oak Ridge and Hanford, almost all of the labor force was kept entirely ignorant of the goals of their work. This affected morale, and manpower retention, in a severe way. The civilians who worked at Oak Ridge and Hanford were not doing so under duress; they could leave and do other war work if they wanted to. The rate of labor turn-over at Hanford, where living conditions were poor, was 20%. At Oak Ridge, it was 17%. Thus, even when the project’s overall labor force was growing by tens of thousands of new employees each month, it was also having to make up losses of thousands per month as well. — location: [1096](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1096) ^ref-17091

---
One postwar report at Oak Ridge closely linked the problems of secrecy and the problems of morale: The war worker in Oak Ridge, Tennessee has been working under some of the most unique working conditions ever known. Due to the secrecy surrounding the nature of the Project, he never saw the results of this labor. There was nothing in which he could take pride. Thus, one of the common incentives for work was not present. No sense of satisfaction could be realized in a job well done. Naturally, this created quite a problem of morale not commonly experienced.14 — location: [1107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1107) ^ref-12659

Lastly, the white badge indicated people allowed to know the full scope of what they were doing at Los Alamos, though their access to specific technical information would be decided by their own division and group leaders. For those with white badges, Los Alamos could be relatively free, if they could make a case for their “need to know”: scientists had authority to choose what could be talked about, and to whom, once they were within that category.19 — location: [1135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1135) ^ref-6495

Oppenheimer also secured permission from an extremely reluctant Groves to have a laboratory-wide weekly colloquia series where anyone with a white badge could attend to discuss specific scientific problems relating to the project’s goals. This sort of activity apparently did not take place at other scientific laboratories associated with the bomb work (like Berkeley or Chicago), and this made Los Alamos a special place, befitting, perhaps, its isolated status. — location: [1143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1143) ^ref-62404

Scientists who challenged this tight control were at risk. None did this more than Leo Szilard, prompting Groves to draw up papers for his internment for the duration of the war; fortunately for Szilard, these were rejected by the secretary of war.29 — location: [1188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1188) ^ref-41582

How far would Groves and his counterintelligence agents go to stem threats? Would they have gone further than incarceration? There are rumors, perhaps impossible to confirm, that they might have been willing to take extreme measures in some cases. Jean Tatlock, a former girlfriend of Oppenheimer, died under suspicious circumstances during the war. Tatlock was considered by the security forces to be a Communist or Communist-sympathizer, and in the summer of 1943, Oppenheimer was surveilled as he spent the night at her apartment in San Francisco. In January 1944, Tatlock was found in her apartment by her father, “lying on a pile of pillows at the end of the bathtub, with her head submerged in the partly filled tub.” The cause of death was asphyxiation by drowning, and barbiturates and chloral hydrate (the active ingredient of “Mickey Finn” knockout drops) were found in her system. A suicide note in a shaky hand was present at the scene. Did she die by her own hand, or was it something else? It sounds too cloak and dagger to be true, but later revelations about “active measures” taken by American security forces during World War II and the Cold War make it hard to completely dismiss the idea that Tatlock may have been seen as a security risk too dangerous to tolerate. — location: [1191](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1191) ^ref-43693

In his memoirs, Groves went to great pains to emphasize that for him, the “speed of the accomplishment was paramount”: [S]ecurity was not the primary object of the Manhattan Project. Our mission was to develop an atomic bomb of such power that it would bring the war to an end at the earliest possible date. Security was an essential element, but not all-controlling. . . . All procedures and decisions on security, including the clearance of personnel, had to be based on what was believed to be the overriding consideration—completion of the bomb.34 — location: [1220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1220) ^ref-22792

The number of actual spies in the Manhattan Project was quite finite—at most around a dozen, out of a project that had well over 10,000 technical workers and hundreds of thousands of non-technical workers—but important.41 Almost all of the ones who had access to secrets directly were “moles,” scientists or engineers who had volunteered their services to the Soviets, as opposed to trained Soviet agents. — location: [1265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1265) ^ref-58752

In one of his final meetings with President Roosevelt, in December 1944, Groves had explained that “there was every evidence the Russians were continuing to spy on our work, particularly at Berkeley.” This was not taken as any great scandal: its chief import was as to whether the Soviet Union should be “brought in” on the secret. Groves ultimately rejected this option, believing “that it was essential not to take them into our confidence until we were sure to get a real quid pro quo from our frankness.”42 Secrets, in this framing, were things to be bartered away at a later date. — location: [1269](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1269) ^ref-21883

Atomic energy had been a big story in the early 1940s; it would not vanish completely just because scientific publications on the matter had stopped. In fact, the lack of scientific publications could itself be suspicious. Time magazine noted that scientific meetings in May 1942 were under-attended and exceptionally vague, and that “exploration of the atom—chief interest of physicists—has come to a stop”: Such facts as these add up to the biggest scientific news of 1942: that there is less and less scientific news. . . . .

The fact that these news stories, along with the sudden drop in fission research publications, were apparently not pieced together by the Axis powers into a coherent understanding that the Manhattan Project existed might be taken as either a success of the Manhattan Project security agents or a failure of Axis intelligence agencies. But it should be noted that the trend here is easier to see in retrospect. Each of these articles also contained significant errors, and the information environment regarding the work on secret weapons in World War II was messy.

There was, however, a group which Groves and others regarded as truly capable of hindering their work: the United States Congress.

The Truman Committee would again have to be dissuaded from probing, having sent an “ugly letter” to the War Department (in Stimson’s reading of it). Stimson reminded him of his previous agreement to leave it alone. Truman was also told by the undersecretary of war that “it is the most important and most secret project that we have.” In his diary, Stimson recorded that Truman “threatened me with dire consequences. I told him I had been directed by the President to do just what I did. Truman is a nuisance and a pretty untrustworthy man. He talks smoothly but he acts meanly.”101 — location: [1564](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1564) ^ref-63799

Not only is it ironic that Truman led the congressional investigation into wasteful spending that kept knocking at the front door of the manhattan project, but this has me wondering if he hadn’t been the leader of that investigative committee, would he have dropped the atomic bomb once president?

---
In early March 1945, Groves made an account of the total number of congressmen who had been officially informed about the bomb: seven. He felt that perhaps they ought to take a small delegation of senators and representatives to visit the sites at Hanford and Oak Ridge, so they could see that the worst rumors about waste or misspending were unfounded. Los Alamos was completely off limits. This visit would be desirable, he noted to Stimson, “from the security standpoint alone, as well as from the standpoint of minimizing the Congressional investigation with which we will be faced after the war.”111 — location: [1604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1604) ^ref-28378

when the War Department did seek out congressmen to let them “in on the secret,” they got strong support. Sociologists of secrecy have long noted that the ritualistic aspects of being “let in” on a secret can reinforce loyalty—the oaths, hushed ceremony, and grave warnings—seemingly heighten a sense of tribal belonging and encourage complicity, and this may be part of the story.113 — location: [1616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1616) ^ref-64115

For Groves, Stimson, Bush, and even Roosevelt, the importance of the bomb trumped the usual demands for transparent democratic institutions. It is this legacy that is perhaps the most chilling aspect of the Manhattan Project. Yet it is this aspect which, in the postwar period, was the least examined: Congress was willing to accept that it had to be left out of the loop, and that security might necessitate a reduction in accountability.115 — location: [1625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1625) ^ref-45662

As the project went on, many Chicago scientists migrated to other wartime sites, but many were kept at the Met Lab in a sort of scientific holding pen, where they would still be under the constraints of security but their access to weapons work was limited. The result was that many of these scientists, well acquainted with the bomb program but unable to further contribute to it technically, began thinking seriously about what would come next. — location: [1645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1645) ^ref-58686

Smyth saw the bomb as coming directly from basic and fundamental research, and thus reasoned that in order to stay ahead, the United States would have to further invest in more basic research. That the Manhattan Project approach could not continue into the postwar period he considered obvious, as its monopolization of university scientists would make the training of new scientists impossible, and no good research scientists would want to join up with such a practically-minded, government-run entity. — location: [1655](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1655) ^ref-2675

university scientists would return to the universities after the war, and new people would not be drawn into a field stifled by secrecy.

Furthermore, if Manhattan Project papers could be downgraded in classification to “Restricted” or “Confidential” (which have far fewer restrictions than “Secret,” much less “Top Secret”) it would allow wider circulation during the “transition” period that would inevitably occur after the wartime regime ended.121 As will be clear in the next chapter, Smyth’s shift toward a demarcating approach likely owes much to the fact that he had been recently engaged in trying to make exactly these sorts of judgments for his technical history of the project; it is one thing to imagine eliminating secrecy in the abstract, it is another to actually try to apply these principles to something concrete. — location: [1689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1689) ^ref-24690

In an “Informal Memorandum” on postwar atomic policies in March 1944, Shurcliff argued that maintaining secrecy over the long term would probably be called for, though some leakage was inevitable (it would be “almost irresistible” for people “in the know” to reveal it at some point), and that no doubt confusion would be caused when scientists “rediscovered” classified principles: “Rediscoverers” located in [the] USA may be expected to tender their “discoveries” to the government and to feel puzzled and even resentful if the government expresses no interest or places the entire matter under secrecy and then expresses no interest. By repeatedly pestering the government (and perhaps press and congressmen also) with ideas already well known to the government and perhaps already in use by it, the rediscoverers will soon be able to make a fair estimate of the secret project.124 — location: [1711](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1711) ^ref-61619

The predominant scientists’ view would have required a total commitment and total confidence: if secrets did matter, then releasing them would be disastrous, for they could not be “recalled” once let out. If secrets were of marginal importance to domestic development, the only detriment would be slowed American innovation, but, as Shurcliff pointed out, this was significant only if you believed that a more primitive atomic bomb could be made irrelevant by a more sophisticated one. The positions of the scientists against secrecy were probably purposefully extreme, though, in anticipation that the “conservative” position would likely be the default, and their appeals to the importance of openness as a scientific norm were also blatant appeals for a restoration of their own lost autonomy. — location: [1768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1768) ^ref-46619

Both Stimson and Groves had brought reports for Truman to read.138 Stimson’s was to the point: within a few months, the United States will likely have “the most terrible weapon ever known in human history, one bomb of which could destroy a whole city,” but once used, it would only be a matter of time until other nations acquired their own. Long-term thinking would need to be applied to avoid the destruction of civilization.139 — location: [1785](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1785) ^ref-39000

As it turned out, the German atomic program was quite modest and nowhere close to creating a bomb by the end of the war.

After specifying the “external” threats, Groves then turned to the “internal.” Compartmentalization, he explained to his son, could be used “to keep members of the project working on their own tasks, rather than thinking and worrying about the tasks of others.” Again, this was an organizational use of secrecy practices, as a form of labor practice, reflecting, no doubt, Groves’ particular disdain for the unruly academics.

The newness of it is plainly clear in some of its more mundane traces. Classified “cover sheets” would become a staple of the US national security state, indicating at a glance to anyone who came into contact with them that they were entering into the province of secrets.

it is interesting to note to whom the Smyth Report gives the lion’s share of credit for making the atomic bomb: the physicists and physics as a discipline. As the historian Rebecca Press Schwartz has argued, Smyth’s focus on physics likely had multiple origins.16 Smyth was himself a physicist, and clearly did see the physical nature of the atomic bomb as what distinguished it from all other past weapons. Without nuclear fission, there would be no bomb. But this focus also obscured the contributions of chemists, metallurgists, and engineers to the project. Complex scientific-industrial processes such as the atomic bomb involve a multitude of experts of all sorts, and within the Manhattan Project the organizational charts reflected an awareness that physics was hardly king, even though many of the top scientist-administrators were indeed physicists. — location: [1958](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=1958) ^ref-56353

All of the speculative topics had been culled, though Laurence still turned in a story arguing that “in atomic power man at last has a fuel powerful enough to free him from the gravitational bonds of the earth. . . . The Interplanetary Era may be just around the corner.” This story was emphatically nixed. “This story is NOT appropriate for War Department use,” an attached note explained, and the draft itself was crossed out with “NO” written on it many times, including once by Groves himself.49 — location: [2186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2186) ^ref-8165

Laurence’s accepted stories were heavily edited by Groves’ people, mainly to tighten them up and to remove Laurence’s often florid language—the Hanford project was an “Atomland-on-Mars,” which apparently the Army officials found a bit too much to swallow (they replaced it with “the project”).50 — location: [2190](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2190) ^ref-13339

“Within forty-eight hours thereafter,” they would release the Smyth Report, which Groves emphasized was both safe and essential for his information strategy. The Smyth Report was still the one part of this strategy that had not yet been finalized, since Stimson had wanted it cleared by the President himself.

Stimson had by that point decided to recommend to Truman that it be published.

Any sufficiently industrialized nation could make such bombs, they continued, and it would surely be easier now that the US had demonstrated which methods were feasible. “The danger is that we would never know, if secrecy prevails as between countries, whether this were indeed the case,” and thus the US might proceed under the dangerous delusion of its enemies’ inability to retaliate. — location: [2642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2642) ^ref-49993

It is worth reemphasizing how radical the positions of Bohr, Bush, and Conant were regarding international control, and how impressive it is that they managed to get any traction at all in high levels of government. The argument was that a new technology—the atomic bomb—would require a remaking of the world. International politics and industrial practices would both have to be forever changed. The Soviet Union would have to open up to inspection, or else. Their imaginations included wars that could end civilization as it was known, and they worried that secrecy might turn these fears into realities. But making practical policy on this matter would prove difficult. In the postwar period, Bush would write to Truman directly on the matter, emphasizing the starkness of their options. There were only “two paths”: “international collaboration” or a “secret arms race on atomic energy,” the latter of which could lead to “a very unhappy world.” — location: [2659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2659) ^ref-5756

Private scientists creating their own laboratory reactors ran the risk of producing huge numbers of neutrons, or even a meltdown, and the threat of the actions of “overenthusiastic and not well-trained physicists in universities” would require “drastic regulation” to rein in. Moreover, they were beginning to see this as a unique regulatory problem that went beyond simple funding of scientific work, as nuclear fission was a “new art and the potentialities are almost beyond reckoning,” — location: [2685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2685) ^ref-42857

It called for the creation of a nine-member Atomic Energy Commission similar to Conant’s initial suggestion, but with vastly expanded powers. The commission was granted total supervision and direction “over all matters connected with atomic research, the production of atomic fission, and the release of nuclear energy,” limited only by the jurisdiction of the United States. It would claim custody of all ores of fissionable material and all means by which fissional material could be produced and allowed the President to appropriate any property he deemed “necessary and proper for the use of the Commission” through eminent domain and condemnation, including patents. The commission would be allowed to fund related research and grant licenses for research by nongovernmental entities (contractors), and the act would make it “unlawful for any person to conduct atomic research or experimentation concerning the release of nuclear energy, without the consent, and subject to the direction and supervision” of the commission. The commission was also authorized to develop and administer security regulations “governing the collection, dissemination, publication, transmission, and communication of all information, data, documents, equipment and material of any kind relating to or connected with atomic research and the release of nuclear energy.” — location: [2698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2698) ^ref-48950

In Bush’s mind, the commission should be like a combination of the Food and Drug Administration and the OSRD, not a military hegemon. Congress, he felt, would not grant such “sweeping and unrestricted powers.” As for the broad power the bill granted the commission to control all information on “atomic research,” Bush considered that it “undoubtedly goes too far at the present time and would be unenforceable.” The commission should “certainly” control information created at its own plants and in work that it has contracted for, and over information “relating directly to the embodiment of results in military devices,” but beyond that, Bush was unsure. The long-term question of secrecy in nuclear science still vexed him, and he was “quite sure that any attempt to control as generally as this section would indicate would be quite futile.” — location: [2712](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2712) ^ref-13894

Whoops.

Bush and Conant believed the bomb might necessitate a changing of the world order, but not the abandonment of checks and balances. But such was the danger in investing so much rhetorical power in the revolutionary nature of the atomic bomb: once endowed with the power of life and death of an entire nation, it could justify a wide variety of far-reaching and radical policies. — location: [2759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2759) ^ref-11214

For Groves, the key was not controlling information—that could leak out or be stolen by spies. Instead, he wanted to control the uranium. Without access to large stores of uranium, there would be no enrichment, and no reactors. Over the course of the war, Groves encouraged a secret and extensive effort to identify all known uranium (and thorium) reserves in the world, and through secret contracts and agreements to secure control over them by the Anglo-American Combined Development Trust. By the end of the war, he felt certain that the United States had extended its monopoly forward by decades. — location: [2763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2763) ^ref-39369

General Groves was a materialist! Not to mention, this looks like the proposal to manage AI by controlling stores of hard drives, which at face, seems pretty reasonable.

Secrecy preoccupied the congressional testimony. The emphasis on the importance of wartime secrecy had given them the idea that the wartime work had been about acquiring “the secret,” as opposed to a massive scientific, military, and industrial collaboration.41 Several representatives openly lamented that the “valuable secret” of the bomb might be released by this legislation. — location: [2812](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2812) ^ref-59619

Third, and most important to Groves, were the industrial techniques, a combination of practical applications of scientific knowledge, managerial practices, and the solutions to all the various challenges (“know-how”). The US was ahead, Groves emphasized, and might remain so for some time, but could not rest on its achievements. Secrecy alone could not guarantee security, and the American military policy couldn’t rely on maintaining the present atomic monopoly, as Groves emphasized: “This is a secret that cannot be held; it is just a question of time.”43 It is worth highlighting how relatively nuanced this take on secrecy was, compared to both those who held “the secret” to be something totemic, and those who dismissed secrecy altogether, and it is in contrast with Groves’ usual reputation. — location: [2822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2822) ^ref-33107

He observed that the scientists would oppose any bill that sought to regulate them: “Scientists are not used to being controlled; they are not used to regimentation, and there are good reasons why they should be averse to it, because it is in the nature of science that the individual is to be given a certain amount of freedom to invent, to think, and to carry on the best he knows how.”45 — location: [2842](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2842) ^ref-53803

Congressmen resented that the bill had been drafted without any congressional input, and that it gave Congress no input into the nation’s atomic program other than providing funding. The witnesses could not simultaneously tell them that atomic energy was the most important thing in the world and also not give them any power or oversight over its operation. — location: [2846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2846) ^ref-27393

The bill’s authors had employed a legislative trick favored by James Newman in earlier drafts: create a novel legal term, then indicate the scope of the term, then indicate that the commission would have powers over that term. In this case, they created a new category of information entitled “restricted data.” “Restricted data” would be defined as “all data concerning the manufacture or utilization of atomic weapons, the production of fissionable material, or the use of fissionable material in the production of power.”69 This seemingly straightforward definition is in fact extraordinarily broad: the “secrets” in this case were defined by their nature and not by an act of regulation, which make them different from every other category of secrecy in the United States. — location: [2963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2963) ^ref-55170

because “restricted data” was defined as “all data,” not “all data created by the Commission” or some other limiting factor, the statute was open to the interpretation that nuclear weapons information is “born secret,” no matter who or where the new information comes from. No other statute on secrecy has ever been defined so broadly in the United States. — location: [2972](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2972) ^ref-3472

the Senate committee added these specific security provisions because they interpreted the Espionage Act to apply only to documents, not the transmittal of information.72 This was deemed too feeble to protect something as dangerous as “top-secret information concerning the atomic bomb,” which could come in many forms. Amending the Espionage Act would be a legislative battle in and of itself, so they had taken it upon themselves to craft a replacement that would work for their special subject. — location: [2982](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2982) ^ref-51150

The “restricted data” solution, in McMahon’s view, was a worthy compromise, since by setting all data as classified by default, the commission’s only act could be to withdraw classification status. As he put it: “The Commission’s withdrawal power can only reduce—it cannot enlarge—the scope of the crime.” Thus, he concluded, the needs of “both military security and scientific progress” were satisfied.73 — location: [2988](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2988) ^ref-64446

The McMahon Committee feared an Atomic Energy Commission that could classify things at will. To avoid this, they had Congress preemptively classify everything potentially related to nuclear weapons or nuclear power, and then gave the commission power to withdraw information from that category. — location: [2992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=2992) ^ref-41488

the “dissemination of scientific and technical information relating to atomic energy should be permitted and encouraged so as to provide that free interchange of ideas and criticisms which is essential to scientific progress.” The report acknowledged that this was diametrically opposed to information restriction, but said that juxtaposing these two “considerations of opposite tendency” would “frame a program that will reconcile their apparent divergence.”75 The circumstances created conditions that, as we shall see, the newly created Atomic Energy Commission found difficult to understand and enforce. McMahon’s idea that writing deliberately contradictory legislation would lead to enlightened governance is perhaps as much of an indicator of his inexperience as anything else. — location: [3002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SL9YB5B&location=3002) ^ref-59805
