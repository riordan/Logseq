## Highlights
The first myth is that nonhuman systems (be it computers or horses) are analogues for human minds. This perspective assumes that with sufficient training, or enough resources, humanlike intelligence can be created from scratch, without addressing the fundamental ways in which humans are embodied, relational, and set within wider ecologies. The second myth is that intelligence is something that exists independently, as though it were natural and distinct from social, cultural, historical, and political forces. — location: [72](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=72) ^ref-47799

Hans was taught to mimic tasks within a very constrained range: add, subtract, and spell words. This reflects a limited perspective of what horses or humans can do. Hans was already performing remarkable feats of interspecies communication, public performance, and considerable patience, yet these were not recognized as intelligence. As author and engineer Ellen Ullman puts it, this belief that the mind is like a computer, and vice versa, has “infected decades of thinking in the computer and cognitive sciences,” creating a kind of original sin for the field. — location: [104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=104) ^ref-41760

due to the capital required to build AI at scale and the ways of seeing that it optimizes AI systems are ultimately designed to serve existing dominant interests. In this sense, artificial intelligence is a registry of power. — location: [128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=128) ^ref-26997

Would this mean that if it weren’t for the intense capital costs that these AI technologies wouldn’t still reinforce existing dominant interests?

how artificial intelligence is made, in the widest sense, and the economic, political, cultural, and historical forces that shape it. Once we connect AI within these broader structures and social systems, we can escape the notion that artificial intelligence is a purely technical domain. — location: [130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=130) ^ref-58418

---
At a fundamental level, AI is technical and social practices, institutions and infrastructures, politics and culture. Computational reason and embodied work are deeply interlinked: AI systems both reflect and produce social relations and understandings of the world. — location: [132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=132) ^ref-65251

---
the term “artificial intelligence” can create discomfort in the computer science community. The phrase has moved in and out of fashion over the decades and is used more in marketing than by researchers. “Machine learning” is more commonly used in the technical literature. Yet the nomenclature of AI is often embraced during funding application season, when venture capitalists come bearing checkbooks, or when researchers are seeking press attention for a new scientific result. As a result, the term is both used and rejected in ways that keep its meaning in flux. — location: [134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=134) ^ref-64199

---
Perhaps my favorite account of how a cartographic approach can be helpful comes from the physicist and technology critic Ursula Franklin: “Maps represent purposeful endeavors: they are meant to be useful, to assist the traveler and bridge the gap between the known and the as yet unknown; they are testaments of collective knowledge and insight.”22 — location: [157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=157) ^ref-14231

---
Maps, at their best, offer us a compendium of open pathways—shared ways of knowing—that can be mixed and combined to make new interconnections. — location: [160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=160) ^ref-3600

---
there are also maps of domination, those national maps where territory is carved along the fault lines of power: from the direct interventions of drawing borders across contested spaces to revealing the colonial paths of empires. — location: [161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=161) ^ref-29630

---
By invoking an atlas, I’m suggesting that we need new ways to understand the empires of artificial intelligence. We need a theory of AI that accounts for the states and corporations that drive and dominate it, the extractive mining that leaves an imprint on the planet, the mass capture of data, and the profoundly unequal and increasingly exploitative labor practices that sustain it. These are the shifting tectonics of power in AI. — location: [162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=162) ^ref-28659

---
One of the founders of artificial intelligence and early experimenter in facial recognition, Woody Bledsoe, put it most bluntly: “in the long run, AI is the only science.”26 This is a desire not to create an atlas of the world but to be the atlas—the dominant way of seeing. This colonizing impulse centralizes power in the AI field: it determines how the world is measured and defined while simultaneously denying that this is an inherently political activity. — location: [174](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=174) ^ref-43929

---
The underlying visions of the AI field do not come into being autonomously but instead have been constructed from a particular set of beliefs and perspectives. The chief designers of the contemporary atlas of AI are a small and homogenous group of people, based in a handful of cities, working in an industry that is currently the wealthiest in the world. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=203) ^ref-38157

---
Instead, this is an expanded view of artificial intelligence as an extractive industry. The creation of contemporary AI systems depends on exploiting energy and mineral resources from the planet, cheap labor, and data at scale. To observe this in action, we will go on a series of journeys to places that reveal the makings of AI. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=218) ^ref-1039

---
The tech sector’s demand for rare earth minerals, oil, and coal is vast, but the true costs of this extraction is never borne by the industry itself. — location: [222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=222) ^ref-52739

---
From the invention of the stopwatch to Google’s TrueTime, the process of time coordination is at the heart of workplace management. — location: [234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=234) ^ref-49816

---
AI technologies both require and create the conditions for ever more granular and precise mechanisms of temporal management. Coordinating time demands increasingly detailed information about what people are doing and how and when they do it. — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=235) ^ref-8503

---
When these collections of data are no longer seen as people’s personal material but merely as infrastructure, the specific meaning or context of an image or a video is assumed to be irrelevant. Beyond — location: [240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=240) ^ref-3470

---
By looking at how classifications are made, we see how technical schemas enforce hierarchies and magnify inequity. Machine learning presents us with a regime of normative reasoning that, when in the ascendant, takes shape as a powerful governing rationality. — location: [248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=248) ^ref-29175

---
AI systems are built with the logics of capital, policing, and militarization—and this combination further widens the existing asymmetries of power. These ways of seeing depend on the twin moves of abstraction and extraction: abstracting away the material conditions of their making while extracting more information and resources from those least able to resist. — location: [263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=263) ^ref-21780

Since antiquity, the business of mining has only been profitable because it does not have to account for its true costs: including environmental damage, the illness and death of miners, and the loss to the communities it displaces. In 1555, Georgius Agricola, known as the father of mineralogy, observed that “it is clear to all that there is greater detriment from mining than the value of the metals which the mining produces.” — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=340) ^ref-24830

---
In other words, those who profit from mining do so only because the costs must be sustained by others, those living and those not yet born. It is easy to put a price on precious metals, but what is the exact value of a wilderness, a clean stream, breathable air, the health of local communities? It was never estimated, and thus an easy calculus emerged: extract everything as rapidly as possible. It was the “move fast and break things” of a different time. — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=343) ^ref-10410

As San Francisco drew enormous wealth from the mines, it was easy for its populace to forget where it all came from. The mines were located far from the city they enriched, and this remoteness allowed city dwellers to remain ignorant of what was happening to the mountains, rivers, and laborers that fed their fortunes. — location: [349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=349) ^ref-34923

---
Brechin suggests that we should think of the skyscrapers of San Francisco as inverted minescapes. The ores extracted from holes in the ground were sold to create the stories in the air; the deeper the extractions went, the higher the great towers of office work stretched into the sky. — location: [354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=354) ^ref-57461

---
The effects of large-scale computation can be found in the atmosphere, the oceans, the earth’s crust, the deep time of the planet, and the brutal impacts on disadvantaged populations around the world. To understand it all, we need a panoramic view of the planetary scale of computational extraction. — location: [372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=372) ^ref-32377

---
The mining that makes AI is both literal and metaphorical. The new extractivism of data mining also encompasses and propels the old extractivism of traditional mining. The stack required to power artificial intelligence systems goes well beyond the multilayered technical stack of data modeling, hardware, servers, and networks. The full-stack supply chain of AI reaches into capital, labor, and Earth’s resources—and from each, it demands an enormous amount. — location: [407](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=407) ^ref-35772

---
In his book A Geology of Media, theorist Jussi Parikka suggests we think of media not from Marshall McLuhan’s point of view—in which media are extensions of the human senses—but rather as extensions of Earth.19 Computational media now participate in geological (and climatological) processes, from the transformation of the earth’s materials into infrastructures and devices to the powering of these new systems with oil and gas reserves. — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=412) ^ref-60129

---
Each object in the extended network of an AI system, from network routers to batteries to data centers, is built using elements that required billions of years to form inside the earth. From the perspective of deep time, we are extracting Earth’s geological history to serve a split second of contemporary technological time, building devices like the Amazon Echo and the iPhone that are often designed to last for only a few years. — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=417) ^ref-48416

---
The massive ecosystem of AI relies on many kinds of extraction: from harvesting the data made from our daily activities and expressions, to depleting natural resources, and to exploiting labor around the globe so that this vast planetary network can be built and maintained. And AI extracts far more from us and the planet than is widely known. — location: [429](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=429) ^ref-63058

---
The elements can be found in color displays, speakers, camera lenses, rechargeable batteries, hard drives, and many other components. They are key elements in communication systems, from fiber-optic cables and signal amplification in mobile communication towers to satellites and GPS technology. But extracting these minerals from the ground often comes with local and geopolitical violence. — location: [444](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=444) ^ref-29716

---
To understand the business of AI, we must reckon with the war, famine, and death that mining brings with it. — location: [449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=449) ^ref-46344

---
According to the computer manufacturer Dell, the complexities of the metals and mineral supply chains pose almost insurmountable challenges to the production of conflict-free electronics components. The elements are laundered through such a vast number of entities along the chain that sourcing their provenance proves impossible — location: [471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=471) ^ref-54492

Ignorance of the supply chain is baked into capitalism, — location: [476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WKQ1MTM&location=476) ^ref-18544
