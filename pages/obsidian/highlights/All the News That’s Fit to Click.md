## Highlights
If, on the one hand, the audience primarily matters as a route to subscription and advertising revenue for news businesses, then metrics are an inappropriate incursion of market forces into the newsroom and best avoided. But if, on the other hand, the audience represents the democratic public (or at least an important slice of it), then metrics should factor heavily into journalistic practice, because the audience’s size and engagement level speak to how effectively journalists are performing their sacred civic mission. — location: [636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08YPF6VQ4&location=636) ^ref-37506

Media scholar Matthew Hindman expresses perhaps the strongest version of this view when he writes that “journalists now have a positive obligation to use these new audience measurement tools,” just as a doctor should use the most accurate diagnostic test available and a lawyer must familiarize herself with relevant case law.39 — location: [667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08YPF6VQ4&location=667) ^ref-18003
