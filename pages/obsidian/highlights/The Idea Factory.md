## Highlights
Like any elite organization, it suffered at times from personality clashes, institutional arrogance, and—especially in its later years—strategic missteps. Yet understanding the circumstances that led up to that unusual winter of 1947 at Bell Labs, and what happened there in the years afterward, promises a number of insights into how societies progress. — location: [178](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=178) ^ref-11074

Some contemporary thinkers would lead us to believe that twenty-first-century innovation can only be accomplished by small groups of nimble, profit-seeking entrepreneurs working amid the frenzy of market competition. — location: [191](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=191) ^ref-14911

This is too simplistic. To consider what occurred at Bell Labs, to glimpse the inner workings of its invisible and now vanished “production lines,” is to consider the possibilities of what large human organizations might accomplish. — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=193) ^ref-25858

The astonishing drop in manufacturing jobs and the unrelenting misery in the American farm belt drove down phone subscriptions—and with them AT&T’s revenue. In the course of three years, between 1930 and 1933, more than 2.5 million households, most of them Bell subscribers, disconnected from the phone grid. In 1932 alone, the number of telephones with Bell service dropped by 1.65 million. Western Electric laid off 80 percent of its workforce. — location: [662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=662) ^ref-1409

Charles Townes, who’d been raised on a farm near Greenville, South Carolina. To grow up that way, he would later explain, made you “pay attention to the natural world, to work with machinery, and to know how to solve practical problems and fix things innovatively, with what is on hand.” In Townes’s view, those “farms and small towns are good training grounds for experimental physics.”14 — location: [705](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=705) ^ref-64651

---
In the earliest days of AT&T, company engineers realized the daunting implications of such growth: The larger the system became, the larger the challenges would be in managing its complexity and structural integrity. It was also likely that the larger the system became, the higher the cost might be to individual subscribers unless technologies became more efficient. — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=803) ^ref-11702

their agreements with state and federal governments obliged them to improve it economically, too. Every employee on West Street was therefore encouraged to take a similar perspective on the future: Phone service not only had to get better and bigger. It had to get cheaper. — location: [807](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=807) ^ref-62485

Danielian painted an ugly picture of how Ma Bell executives had used propaganda—books, periodicals, short films—to enhance their corporate image during the 1920s. In his view, moreover, AT&T’s size and dominating nature raised the question of whether it was actually an “industrial dictatorship” obscured by a scrim of civic-mindedness. — location: [813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=813) ^ref-28759

---
“The [Bell] System,” Danielian pointed out, “constitutes the largest aggregation of capital that has ever been controlled by a single private company at any time in the history of business. It is larger than the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and United States Steel Corporation put together. Its gross revenues of more than one billion dollars a year are surpassed by the incomes of few governments of the world. The System comprises over 200 vassal corporations. Through some 140 companies it controls between 80 and 90 percent of local telephone service and 98 percent of the long-distance telephone wires of the United States.” — location: [816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=816) ^ref-64416

It was also, not incidentally, the largest employer in the United States.7 — location: [823](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=823) ^ref-10293

---
The larger point in all of this was that Bell Labs, for all its romantic forays into the mysteries of science, remained an integral part of the phone business. The Labs management made an effort to isolate its scientists from the gritty day-to-day political concerns of the business. But the managers themselves had to keep track of how the technology and politics and finances of their endeavor meshed together. Indeed, they could never forget it. — location: [836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=836) ^ref-14250

Yay industrial research

---
Dial tones and busy signals had to be invented. Lines strung between poles often didn’t work, or worked poorly; lines that were put underground, a necessity in urban centers, had even more perplexing transmission problems. Once telephone engineers realized they could also broadcast messages via radio waves, they encountered a host of other problems (such as atmospheric interference) they had never before contemplated. But slowly they solved these problems, and the result was something that soon came to be known, simply and plainly, as the system. — location: [849](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=849) ^ref-36529

---
The system’s problems and needs were so vast that it was hard to know where to begin explaining them. — location: [854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=854) ^ref-12507

---
The system required that teams of chemists spend their entire lives trying to invent new, cheaper sheathing so that phone cables would not be permeated by rain and ice; the system required that other teams of chemists spend their lives working to improve the insulation that lay between the sheathing and the phone wires themselves. — location: [854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=854) ^ref-24294

---
Measurement devices that could assess things like loudness, signal strength, and channel capacity didn’t exist, so they, too, had to be created—for it was impossible to study and improve something unless it could be measured. Likewise, the system had to keep track of the millions of daily calls within it, which in turn required a vast, novel infrastructure for billing. The system had to account for it all. — location: [858](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=858) ^ref-36251

---
“There is always a larger volume of work that is worth doing than can be done currently,” Kelly said, which was a way of acknowledging that work on the system, by definition, could have no end. — location: [861](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=861) ^ref-13609

---
They fashioned a “woodpecker machine,” meant to resemble “that industrious bird in action,” to test the scratch-resistant qualities of varnishes and finishes. They fabricated what they called an “artificial mouth,” resembling a freestanding microphone, to test the aural sensitivity of handsets; they created a machine with a simulated finger to mimic the demands of button-pushing and dialing. And it wasn’t enough to merely measure the durability of a telephone dial; other teams of engineers had to calibrate and measure, to a level approaching perfection, the precise speed at which the dial rotated. — location: [867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=867) ^ref-15555

Some men at West Street specialized in experimenting on springs for switchboard keys, others in improving the metal within the springs. — location: [872](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=872) ^ref-28680

---
AT&T lines carried transmissions from the Teletype, a machine that could send and translate written messages over long distances—so Labs engineers likewise found it necessary to invent a better teletypewriter oiler, a small square oil can, named the 512A tool. And the Labs engineers were not necessarily content with designing any oil can; this one had to be built with a complex inner mechanism for dispensing up to (but no more than) fifteen drops of lubricant. The 512A was an example of how, if good problems led to good inventions, then good inventions likewise would lead to other related inventions, and that nothing was too small or incidental to be excepted from improvement. — location: [876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=876) ^ref-58675

---
Indeed, the system demanded so much improvement, so much in the way of new products, so much insurance of durability, that new methods had to be created to guarantee there was improvement and durability amid all the novelty. — location: [881](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=881) ^ref-59246

All this is good but is any of it of use?

By the middle of 1940, the research department at Bell Labs stopped doing research as nearly all of the Labs’ work—about 75 percent of it—was redirected toward developing electronic devices for wartime, — location: [1035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1035) ^ref-44412

Is this a model for the climate emergency?

---
“Buckley in essence handed over Bell Laboratories to [Mervin] Kelly during World War II,” one Bell Labs researcher recalled.1 Indeed, Buckley let Kelly—whose research department was essentially dismantled for the duration of the war and replaced by a multitude of development projects—run the day-to-day business of the laboratories from that point on. — location: [1039](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1039) ^ref-51880

---
One of the Labs’ first assignments as the war began in Europe resulted from Jewett’s political connections:2 finding out at the government’s behest whether it was actually possible, in light of several recent theoretical papers on nuclear reactions, to create a weapon out of ordinary uranium. — location: [1042](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1042) ^ref-12328

---
Engineering, however, was different. Kelly defined it as the application of science to a problem affecting society. Engineers dipped into the “common reservoir” of science on behalf of their own industries and countries. In peacetime, that meant they focused on making profitable commodities like automobiles and telephone equipment; in wartime, that meant they focused on building military communications equipment as well as ships, planes, and munitions. — location: [1072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1072) ^ref-19527

---
wartime engineers had an additional responsibility. They were charged not only with building everything better but building everything faster, which meant striving to improve their processes as well as their products. — location: [1076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1076) ^ref-21328

---
“Progress has been made in some fields of technology in a four-year interval,” he pointed out, “that, under the normal conditions of peace, would have required from ten to twenty years.” Much of what Bell Labs was now building hadn’t existed four years before. — location: [1079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1079) ^ref-60491

---
the peacetime needs of the rapidly expanding phone system were an unceasing force for new inventions, in other words, war was turning out to be an even greater force. — location: [1083](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1083) ^ref-26416

---
The Labs actually doubled its size from about forty-six hundred before the war to nine thousand during it. At the West Street offices, Oliver Buckley wrote, “there is hardly room to turn around.” Elevators were so jammed with employees that it was difficult to squeeze on. A six-day workweek became the norm. — location: [1100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1100) ^ref-40929

for the first time, the Labs began to hire Jews, bucking a strain of anti-Semitism that ran deep within the AT&T establishment, — location: [1105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1105) ^ref-52745

---
for many members of the technical staff, the wartime work required a difficult philosophical transformation. The ideas of scientists thrive on publication and broad dissemination; but the ideas of engineers, especially during wartime, thrive only if secrecy is maintained. — location: [1130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1130) ^ref-26070

Scientists who worked on radar often quipped that radar won the war, whereas the atomic bomb merely ended it. This was not a minority view. — location: [1153](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1153) ^ref-18198

---
Notably, radar was a far larger investment on the part of the U.S. government, probably amounting to $3 billion as contrasted with $2 billion for the atomic bomb. In addition, radar wasn’t a single kind of device but multiple devices—there were dozens of different models—employing a similar technology that could be used on the ground, on water, or in the air. — location: [1155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1155) ^ref-26875

He was fond of putting his colleagues on mailing lists of doctors peddling dubious tonics. When a friend of his went away for a week to a New Hampshire resort, Fisk sent to him a series of telegrams that resembled the instructions of an underworld gangster to one of his cronies.24 At the magnetron workshop in the old biscuit factory, Fisk sometimes wore a striped train engineer’s cap and, on occasion, striped overalls to meetings. “After all, we’re engineers,” — location: [1227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1227) ^ref-14004

Fisk—perhaps seeking a diversion from the grinding six-days-a-week schedule—came up with the notion that the propulsion system of sharks was worth studying for applications to naval warfare. He decided to try to requisition $50,000 for a swimming pool, to be constructed in the basement of the biscuit building, from Bell Labs management. It was a joke with an appearance of plausibility (in fact, many years later at Bell Labs, biological systems would become an acceptable research pursuit). Fisk’s request rose through the executive ranks, receiving several green lights, until it got to Kelly, who instantly rejected it.26 — location: [1240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1240) ^ref-16847

in May 1943. Kelly’s point was not to outline precisely what new products the company should make at the close of war. Rather, he felt compelled to outline his vision of how Bell Labs, once it regrouped, would fare within an electronics industry that was sure to grow exponentially after the war’s conclusion. — location: [1292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1292) ^ref-43193

“We have been a conservative and non-competitive organization. We engineer for high quality service, with long life, low maintenance costs, [and a] high factor of reliability as basic elements in our philosophy of design and manufacture.

Murray Hill had already been acquired. In July 1930 Frank Jewett, the Labs president, had called a public meeting near the future location to announce the land acquisition and describe a plan to build a research facility.1 Those plans had been put on hold until the worst years of the Depression had passed, and in 1938 the idea of a grand suburban laboratory was revived by Jewett, then–vice — location: [1323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1323) ^ref-19419

Essentially Kelly was creating interdisciplinary groups—combining chemists, physicists, metallurgists, and engineers; combining theoreticians with experimentalists—to work on new electronic technologies. — location: [1388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1388) ^ref-42584

---
More fundamentally, however, the coming age of technologies owed its existence to a quiet revolution in materials. Indeed, without new materials—that is, materials that were created through new chemistry techniques, or rare and common metals that could now be brought to a novel state of ultrapurity by resourceful metallurgists—the actual physical inventions of the period might have been impossible. Shockley would have spent his career trapped in a prison of elegant theory. — location: [1424](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1424) ^ref-9230

---
“We had such specific requirements that ordinary raw materials had an agonizing time meeting them,” William Baker, who joined the Labs as a chemist just before World War II, explained.9 The solution, as Baker described it, was to literally create new types of matter. — location: [1431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1431) ^ref-14058

In some respects, Shockley’s idea was illicit. At Bell Labs, there were boundaries, — location: [1791](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1791) ^ref-18154

---
They were not to refuse help to a colleague, regardless of his rank or department, when it might be necessary. And perhaps most important, the supervisor was authorized to guide, not interfere with, the people he (or she) managed. “The management style was, and remained for many years, to use the lightest touch and absolutely never to compete with underlings,” recalls Phil Anderson, a physicist who joined Bell Labs soon after the transistor was developed. “This was the taboo that Shockley transgressed, and was never forgiven.” — location: [1794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1794) ^ref-1618

Dont be thiss asshole

---
So Shockley made the leap, literally. He jumped from his seat and proceeded to give a presentation to the group on his newest theories and design. “I felt I did not want to be left behind on this one,” he recalled. Many of the men were dumbstruck. The solid-state group that Shockley led had been built upon the principles of an open exchange of ideas, and Shockley had apparently ignored those principles. At the same time, it was hard not to be awed—the men were witnessing another breakthrough on the level of Bardeen and Brattain’s earlier work. Did it matter whether it was the product of Shockley’s brilliance and effort, or his cunning and bruised ego? By — location: [1808](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1808) ^ref-63986

---
An irony, at least for that moment, was that Shockley’s phantom invention (the junction transistor) had improved upon another invention (the point-contact transistor) that wasn’t useful in any meaningful sense of the word. Lest anyone forget, the point-contact transistor was a device that had never been manufactured, had never been sold, and was still so secret that perhaps only a few dozen people in the world knew it existed. — location: [1816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1816) ^ref-12328

If an idea begat a discovery, and if a discovery begat an invention, then an innovation defined the lengthy and wholesale transformation of an idea into a technological product (or process) meant for widespread practical use. Almost by definition, a single person, or even a single group, could not alone create an innovation. The task was too variegated and involved. — location: [1884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1884) ^ref-33459

---
In his view, innovation was not a simple action but “a total process” of interrelated parts. “It is not just the discovery of new phenomena, nor the development of a new product or manufacturing technique, nor the creation of a new market,” he later wrote. “Rather, the process is all these things acting together in an integrated way toward a common industrial goal.” — location: [1908](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1908) ^ref-29700

Sounds  like a damn good definition of product

---
One of Morton’s disciples, a Bell Labs development scientist named Eugene Gordon, points out that there were two corollaries to Morton’s view of innovation: The first is that if you haven’t manufactured the new thing in substantial quantities, you have not innovated; the second is that if you haven’t found a market to sell the product, you have not innovated. — location: [1911](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1911) ^ref-14980

This sounds exactly like product thinking

---
But these realizations would come together later. After hearing Kelly’s orders to produce a road map for transistor production, Morton spent the next twenty-nine days in a state of terror. On the thirtieth he settled on a development plan. — location: [1914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1914) ^ref-43946

This is 100% product thinking

In the late 1940s, the Labs executives were simply content to pass out samples of the new device without explaining how they were made. — location: [1965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1965) ^ref-43050

“The plan,” Buckley wrote to his deputy, “is to make a gift of two Transistors put up in a nice little box marked as a gift from the Laboratories.”40 The invention hadn’t made a whit of difference yet in the machinery of the world, of course. From a public relations perspective, though, the little transistor was a godsend. — location: [1970](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=1970) ^ref-27306

“There is nothing magical about science. Our research people are following a straight plan as a part of a system and there is no magic about it.” People rarely disagreed with Kelly to his face. But to visitors, and sometimes to scientists, too, Bell Labs nevertheless was taking on a slightly magical air. And it was hard to deny that wholly unscientific factors—serendipity and chance, for example—played a part in the Labs’ innovations. Hadn’t Bardeen been out of luck in finding an office, for instance, and then just happened to camp out in Brattain’s laboratory? — location: [2004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2004) ^ref-9205

it was called “zone refining,” and was an ingenious adaptation of a technique metallurgists had used on other materials—ranked as one of the most important inventions of the past twenty-five years.

Those who met Shannon at the time usually came away with an impression similar to Vannevar Bush’s: The young man was diffident, amiable, whip-smart. To those who knew him better, he could also be whimsical and prankish, with an insatiable love for games and gadgets. To those such as Norma who knew him better still he could be cold and remote, vanishing with some frequency into depressive sulks or abstraction. He had been exuberant when they first met—taking her up in the Piper Cub he was piloting, “scaring me shitless with his flying,” and enthusiastically dragging her out to jazz shows in the Village and watching with rapt attention while barely touching his drink. Now he would sometimes sit in a chair for hours, a pack of cigarettes for company, without writing or speaking. In other instances—when he got into a minor accident in the couple’s new Buick, a gift from Norma’s father—he would break down in tears. — location: [2112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2112) ^ref-39094

In a math department that thrived on its collective intelligence—where members of the staff were encouraged to work on papers together rather than alone—this set him apart. But in some respects his solitude was interesting, too, for it had become a matter of some consideration at the Labs whether the key to invention was a matter of individual genius or collaboration. To those trying to routinize the process of innovation—the lifelong goal of Mervin Kelly, the Labs’ leader—there was evidence both for and against the primacy of the group. — location: [2355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2355) ^ref-18080

---
It was also the case, as Shockley would later point out, that by the middle of the twentieth century the process of innovation in electronics had progressed to the point that a vast amount of multidisciplinary expertise was needed to bring any given project to fruition. “Things are much more complex than they were probably when Mendel was breeding peas, in which case you would put them in a pot and collect the fruits, and then cover up the blossoms and have that suffice,” Shockley said, — location: [2361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2361) ^ref-46618

---
“With all the needed emphasis on leadership, organization and teamwork, the individual has remained supreme—of paramount importance. It is in the mind of a single person that creative ideas and concepts are born.”40 There was an essential truth to this, too—John Bardeen suddenly suggesting to the solid-state group that they should consider working on the hard-to-penetrate surface states on semiconductors, for instance.

---
Of course, these two philosophies—that individuals as well as groups were necessary for innovation—weren’t mutually exclusive. It was the individual from which all ideas originated, and the group (or the multiple groups) to which the ideas, and eventually the innovation responsibilities, were transferred. The handoffs often proceeded in logical progression: from the scientist pursuing with his colleagues a basic understanding in the research department, to the applied scientist working with a team in the development side, to a group of engineers working on… — location: [2374](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2374) ^ref-14475

In the midst of Shannon’s career, some lawyers in the patent department at Bell Labs decided to study whether there was an organizing principle that could explain why certain individuals at the Labs were more productive than others. They discerned only one common thread: Workers with the most patents often shared lunch or breakfast with a Bell Labs electrical engineer named Harry Nyquist. It wasn’t the case that Nyquist gave them specific ideas. Rather, as one scientist recalled, “he drew people out, got them thinking.” More than anything, Nyquist asked good questions.41 Shannon knew Nyquist, too. And though Shannon worked alone, he would later tell an interviewer that the institution of Bell Labs (its… — location: [2379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2379) ^ref-8839

At first, Shannon began to stay up all night with the Erector Set building small machines. “He built a little turtle that walked around the house,” Betty says. “It would bump into something and back off and walk the other way. And then he built the mouse.” The mouse was named Theseus. It was a small object, built of wood with copper wire whiskers, which was intended to search for a piece of electronic “cheese” within a maze that Shannon also built. Theseus was named in winking recognition of the mythical Greek hero who found a way to navigate a labyrinth ruled by a deadly minotaur. — location: [2443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2443) ^ref-21485

Shannon’s self-proclaimed “ultimate machine,” for instance, seemed a jesting commentary on the subject of the meaning of his tinkerings. It was a wooden box with a single switch.

Around 1954, Hagelbarger on his own built a machine with electromechanical relays that would guess whether a human player had chosen heads or tails on a coin. By taking into account a human player’s tendency to fall into various patterns of guessing, the machine could beat a player about 53 percent of the time, a success rate that Bob Lucky, a Bell Labs executive, later noted, “by chance alone would happen with probability less than one in 10 billion” over the course of about 10,000 trials.16 Shannon was fascinated by his friend’s machine, so he built his own—a simplified version with a smaller memory but greater calculating speed. “After considerable discussion concerning which of these two machines would win over the other we decided to put the matter to an experimental test,” Shannon recalled. The men built a third “umpire machine” to pass information between the two competing machines and keep score. Shannon recalled, “The three machines were plugged together and allowed to run for a few hours to the accompaniment of small side bets and large cheering.” — location: [2539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2539) ^ref-36127

In truth, the handoff between the three departments at Bell Labs was often (and intentionally) quite casual. Part of what seemed to make the Labs “a living organism,” Kelly explained, were social and professional exchanges that moved back and forth, in all directions, between the pure researchers on one side and the applied engineers on the other. — location: [2648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2648) ^ref-35302

These were formal talks and informal chats, and they were always encouraged, both as a matter of policy and by the inventive design of the Murray Hill building. Researchers and engineers would find themselves discussing their respective problems in the halls, over lunch, or they might be paired together on a project, either at their own request or by managers. Or a staffer with a question would casually seek out an expert, “whether he be a mathematician, a metallurgist, an organic chemist, an electromagnetic propagation physicist, or an electron device specialist.” At the Labs this was sometimes known as going to “the guy who wrote the book.” And it was often literally true. The guy who wrote the definitive book on a subject—Shockley on semiconductors, John Tukey on statistics, Claude Shannon on information, and so forth—was often just down the hall. Saddled with a difficult problem, a new hire at Bell Labs, a stuttering nobody, was regularly directed by a supervisor toward one of these men. Some young employees would quake when they were told to go ask Shannon or Shockley a question. Still, Labs policy stated that they could not be turned away. — location: [2650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2650) ^ref-58842

Here, then, was the dilemma: Just because you had made something new and wondrous didn’t mean you would make something else new and wondrous. But Bell Labs had the advantage of necessity; its new inventions, as one of Kelly’s deputies, Harald Friis, once said, “always originated because of a definite need.” In Kelly’s view, the members of the technical staff had the great advantage of working to improve a system where there were always problems, always needs. — location: [2678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2678) ^ref-17969

To innovate, Kelly would agree, an institute of creative technology required the best people, Shockleys and Shannons, for instance—and it needed a lot of them, so many, as the people at the Labs used to say (borrowing a catchphrase from nuclear physics), that departments could have a “critical mass” to foster explosive ideas. — location: [2688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2688) ^ref-49879

---
What’s more, the institute of creative technology should take it upon itself to further the education and abilities of its promising but less accomplished employees, not for reasons of altruism but because industrial science and engineering had become so complex that it now required men and women who were trained beyond the level that America’s graduate schools could attain. — location: [2690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2690) ^ref-48462

---
An institute of creative technology needed to house its critical mass close to one another so they could exchange ideas; it also needed to give them all the tools they needed. Some of these tools took the form of expensive machinery or furnaces for the laboratories. Some of them were human, however. Bell Labs employed thousands of full-time technical assistants who could put the most dedicated graduate students to shame. Such assistants sometimes had only a high school diploma but were dexterous enough, mentally and physically, that PhDs would often speak of them with the same respect they gave their most acclaimed colleagues. The TAs, as they were known, formed a large subculture—a stratum parallel to the one formed by the Labs’ esteemed scientists—where they would exchange valuable information among themselves over lunch. “They were the keepers of practical information,” John Rowell, an experimental physicist, recalls.6 “They knew secrets, tricks. And they knew all this lore about what had been done in the early days.” The best of the assistants had the same talents that Walter… — location: [2695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2695) ^ref-59919

Finally, something else seemed important. “A new device or a new invention,” Kelly once remarked, “stimulates and frequently demands other new devices and inventions for its proper use.”10 Just as the invention of the telephone had led to countless developments in switching and transmission, an invention like the transistor seemed to point to even more developments in switching, transmission, and computer systems. Or to put it another way, the solution to a technological problem invariably created other problems that needed solutions. So making something truly new seemed to ensure that you would be making something else truly new before too long. — location: [2715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2715) ^ref-45549

What made the Labs essential to the Nike program was an expertise in radar and communications. “Telephone technology has much in common with that of new weapons systems,” Kelly remarked as the Nike installations were being built.32 The new missiles, outfitted with several antennas, were guided by a complex control system, both in the air and on the ground, that involved radio detection and guidance and required, according to one assessment, approximately 1.5 million parts. Though nuclear arms and communications were often perceived as distinct phenomena—one was military, the other was civilian; one was deadly, the other benign—it was becoming increasingly difficult to separate the atomic age from the information age. — location: [2835](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2835) ^ref-2128

at the military’s request, Bell Labs and Western Electric also began designing and building a string of remote radar installations in the frozen wastes north of the Arctic Circle from Canada’s Baffin Island to Alaska’s northwestern coast; these installations, “the arctic eye that never sleeps” (as the Bell Laboratories Record put it), were meant to warn North America of a Soviet nuclear attack. Named the DEW—for Distant Early Warning—line and made possible by a string of nonmilitary discoveries years earlier at the Labs regarding microwave communications,33 the defensive systems were sister projects to the Labs’ military work that included BMEWS (Ballistic Missile Early Warning System) and White Alice, which connected radio sensors in Alaska to Air Force command headquarters in Colorado. — location: [2841](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=2841) ^ref-10667

Any element within the system was designed (by Bell Labs) and built (by Western Electric) to last thirty or forty years. Junking a functional part before its time had to be economically justifiable.

In time, Kelly remarked, the traffic and data needs of the system would require replacing tubes and switches with transistors.6 The Labs’ managers had already begun planning for new transistorized phones and an electronic switching station that, as it turned out, would take nearly twenty years to fully deploy.

What was striking but almost always overlooked about its invention, Fuller later recalled, was that all three inventors of the device were working in different buildings. “The solar cell just sort of happened,” he said.

Only 20 percent of those nine thousand worked in basic and applied research, however. Another 20 percent worked on military matters. Meanwhile, the rest of the Labs’ scientists and engineers—the majority—toiled on the never-ending job of planning and developing the system. Their work was arguably less glamorous. The research scientists at the Labs were thinking ahead to a glorious future that was ten or even twenty years away. The development and systems engineers were thinking about what they could do in the next year or two or three. And yet the projects undertaken by the latter group during Kelly’s presidency were in many ways just as ambitious as those done in research; one might see that they were logistically more difficult. In development, mistakes were not excusable.

The cable would still have to prove that it was economically justified. “In the event of a failure in midocean,” Kelly pointed out, “a cable ship would have to lift the cable at that point and make the necessary repairs. In winter, this might well remove the cable from service for two or so months and be a costly operation.”2 By Kelly’s calculations, the cable would have to work for at least twenty years without a single problem in order to pay for itself. For several decades, the safe answer had been to forsake the idea of an ocean cable altogether. — location: [3094](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3094) ^ref-46822

“It was realized that compromise was essential but innovation and relatively untried methods were too risky,” an internal history of the Labs would put it.8 In fact, by the time the first cable was ready for laying down in 1955 (the return cable would go down in 1956), Kelly had made sure that the undersea project, in sum a great innovation, used the least innovative components. A transistor for the repeater system was out of the question; the technology was too new, and there was no telling how long it would last underwater.

Bill Shockley had left to form a transistor company—Shockley Semiconductor—in Palo Alto, California. He had received some help from Kelly, who had introduced him to some wealthy investors. The assistance was almost certainly not selfless. Judging Shockley as unsuited for upper management, Kelly had refused to promote him—and as if to prove Kelly’s judgment correct, Shockley had in 1953 and 1954 sent his boss peevish memos written as “pinks,” the nickname for informal notes, complaining about the Labs and Kelly himself. — location: [3164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3164) ^ref-31182

they would indeed share a Nobel Prize. Brattain refused to attribute the honor to his own genius. “It was really only a stroke of luck,” he later explained, that he and Bardeen, rather than someone else, had gotten there first. Everyone at Bell Labs knew the prize reflected well on Kelly. Even Shockley was moved, in his own way, to share some credit. “It seems to me that this is a suitable occasion for me to repeat what I told you over the telephone when resigning from Bell Telephone Laboratories,” he wrote to Kelly from California upon the receipt of the Nobel. “It is hard for me to see how a research director and vice president in your position could have proceeded more effectively to get a transistor out of a solid state physicist like myself.” — location: [3188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3188) ^ref-7171

The phone company agreed to license its present and future U.S. patents to all American applicants, “with no limit as to time or the use to which they may be put.” In other words, eighty-six hundred or so of AT&T’s U.S. patents “issued prior to January 24, 1956 are in almost all cases to be licensed royalty-free to all applicants.” (All future patents, meanwhile, would be licensed for a small fee.) But this largesse didn’t worry AT&T executives, whose confidence in the strength of their business had now been restored. The patent giveaway was in fact deceptive. So what if entrepreneurs all over the country now had essentially free access to transistors, microwave long-distance systems, underwater repeaters, solar cells, coaxial cables, and thousands of other devices and industrial processes? The Bell System remained a monopoly. Competitors trying to gain a foothold in the telephone equipment business still had no way in. — location: [3206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3206) ^ref-35730

In many respects, says Mathews, a phone monopoly in the early part of the twentieth century made perfect sense. Analog signals—the waves that carry phone calls—are very fragile. “If you’re going to send sound a long way, you have to send it through fifty amplifiers,” he explains, just as the transatlantic cable did. “The only thing that would work is if all the amplifiers in the path were designed and controlled by one entity, being the AT&T company. That was a natural monopoly. The whole system—an analog system—wouldn’t work if it was done by a myriad of companies.”22 But when Shannon explained how all messages could be classified as information, and all information could be digitally coded, it hinted at the end of this necessary monopoly. — location: [3259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3259) ^ref-45358

Mathews argued that Shannon’s theorem “was the mathematical basis for breaking up the Bell System.” If that was so, then perhaps Shockley’s work would be the technical basis for a breakup. The patents, after all, were now there for the taking.

For one thing, it demonstrated that he enjoyed pushing ideas and projects on people—“dropping them on our desks like an egg,” as one of his colleagues would later put it.3 For another, the book suggested that even as a young man Pierce did things quickly and then moved on, excited by another new idea and rarely polishing a finished product after the idea took shape. When he happened to reflect back on the glider book many years later, for instance, he wondered if his work had done actual harm: “Because of me, did human beings build crazy gliders without benefit of engineering, and kill themselves therewith? I wouldn’t be a bit surprised.” He seemed less troubled by that prospect than by the poor quality of his prose. — location: [3288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3288) ^ref-55346

At first he thought he might try chemistry, a science of unforgiving precision, which proved a misstep for a young man with a fascination for electronics and a hummingbird-like tendency to flutter from idea to idea. He was befuddled by his introductory chemistry lectures; even worse, his experiments—“I dropped things, spilled things,” he recalled—were disasters.9 Aeronautical engineering seemed a sensible next step, especially for a young man who had built and flown gliders, and had even written a book on the subject, but he was soon bored with that subject, too, claiming later that his instructors made him draw pictures of rivets over and over again.

Years later, Pierce would avoid giving reporters, as well as readers of his own voluminous writings, the sense that he was calculating or unusually accomplished, sometimes offering the impression instead that his life at Caltech, and the successes that followed, were mostly serendipitous. Though he was eventually the subject of a long profile in the New Yorker, Pierce was inclined to describe his career as a procession of fortunate events rather than the product of his own restless intellect.11 He described himself, depending on the circumstances, as either lucky, lazy, stumbling, or shambling.

The rejections of his stories must have stung him terribly.

He wasn’t certain that Bell engineers knew enough yet to build a foolproof and durable active satellite—one that could operate for more than a few weeks or months. He also knew that the small research department at Bell Labs, unlike the huge development department, lacked the manpower and budget necessary for an active project. “There’s a difference, you see, in thinking idly about something, and in setting out to do something,” he explained to an interviewer in the early 1960s. “You begin to see what the problems are when you set out to do things, and that’s why we thought [passive] would be a good idea.” A passive satellite, he added, probably wouldn’t be useful in terms of the business of communications. But it tested the possibility of orbiting relays before they were developed into something more. A passive satellite, in other words, was an experiment. — location: [3614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3614) ^ref-30928

---
These would be incremental innovations. In such a vision of the future, orbiting satellites weren’t only a risky and unproven technology; they were also—at least to a telephone executive with a well-defined, step-by-step ten-year plan for improving the system—a strange sideways leap. When Kelly said something was dead, it was dead. Except to Pierce. He and Kompfner prepared a long memo in early October 1958 that made their case to Kelly yet again. Pierce showed the memo to his boss, Baker, but it was not sent on to Kelly, almost certainly on Baker’s wise suggestion.15 The strategy was to wait. “Kelly was a great hero of mine,” Pierce later reflected, “and a great leader of Bell Laboratories. Even great men can be wrong.” — location: [3659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3659) ^ref-22800

By then it had become an international curiosity, though, a bright dot streaking regularly across the night sky. Soon after, the Bell System set up a phone service in New York City to tell callers at which times Echo would be visible. A schedule was published in various newspapers as well. At Jones Beach, not far from New York City, the bandleader Guy Lombardo would sometimes look at his watch and momentarily stop his orchestra’s summer evening concert. Then he would suggest that everyone in the audience pause to look up and see Echo, at one point just a curious idea, and now something more, pass overhead.29 — location: [3789](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3789) ^ref-20675

he wrote in a 1957 memo. At the time, Pierce was actually thinking ahead by a decade or two, and wondering where Bell Labs should be with mobile phone research by that point.47 He perceived that the transistor might create entirely new possibilities for mobile communications. — location: [3942](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3942) ^ref-36430

One day, around the time of Echo’s demise, Jakes looked up to see his boss come into his office. “Jakes, why don’t you do something about mobile communications?”49 Pierce asked.

New York’s fair would dwarf Seattle’s. The crowds were expected to be immense—probably somewhere around 50 or 60 million people in total. Pierce and David’s 1961 memo recommended a number of exhibits: “personal hand-carried telephones,” “business letters in machine-readable form, transmitted by wire,” “information retrieval from a distant computer-automated library,” and “satellite and space communications.” — location: [3967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3967) ^ref-33965

---
Perhaps the only surprise was an open demonstration—available to anyone who visited the floating wing—of what Pierce and David had in their memo termed “visiphone.” By 1964, these devices, created by the engineers at Bell Labs over the course of a decade, had a trademarked name. They were known as Picturephones, and they seemed the very essence of the future. — location: [3974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3974) ^ref-33800

---
Without question, the Picturephones were diverting. In several obvious respects, the device was less a radical innovation than an elegant melding of the established technologies of television and telephone. But it wasn’t entirely clear whether the Picturephone actually solved a problem. Some Bell Labs engineers worried about this. As far back as the mid-1950s, John Pierce was exchanging memos with colleagues wondering about the utility of the new device: “The need for acceptability of such a service,” Pierce wrote of the Picturephone, “has not been adequately evaluated, and the [phones] themselves were not at the point at which they could be put into commercial use.”3 To — location: [3983](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3983) ^ref-30913

AT&T executives had in fact decided to use the fair as an opportunity to quietly commission a market research study. That the fairgoers who visited the Bell System pavilion might not represent a cross section of society was recognized as a shortcoming of the survey results. Nevertheless, researchers asked seven hundred users of the Picturephone for their reaction to its design and technology; they also asked whether they might want to use the Picturephone in the future. — location: [3993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3993) ^ref-43057

---
Would they pay for it? Here, the results were less clear. For a price of between $40 and $60 a month, for instance, only 12 percent of the couples interviewed said they would want a Picturephone in their homes. Business customers, however, seemed more amenable. Even if the cost were substantially higher—$60 to $80 a month—29 percent said they would be interested in having the device at their place of business. — location: [3999](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=3999) ^ref-47549

the Labs’ primary innovation of 1964, for all the attention the Picturephone received, was actually something nobody who used a telephone would see or even understand. It was known as ESS No. 1, a new electronic switching station, opened in a small modern building in the village of Succasunna, New Jersey.6 The design for the switching station had taken two thousand “man-years” of work to create and used tens of thousands of transistors. Its complexity dwarfed that of other previous Bell Labs undertakings such as the transatlantic undersea cable. ESS, as Fred Kappel, the chairman of AT&T, pointed out at its opening in Succasunna, “was the largest single research and development project in Bell System history.”7 The costs were acknowledged by AT&T to be “more than” $100 million, which likely suggested they were much more.

One of the more intriguing attributes of the Bell System was that an apparent simplicity—just pick up the phone and dial—hid its increasingly fiendish interior complexity. What also seemed true, and even then looked to be a governing principle of the new information age, was that the more complex the system became in terms of capabilities, speed, and versatility, the simpler and sleeker it appeared. — location: [4020](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4020) ^ref-39681

---
Like the microwave towers that had recently been introduced to the long-distance transmission system—the ones that were a cheaper alternative to cables between cities—electronic switching was, from a user’s point of view, an incremental improvement. If you weren’t a phone engineer, it was hard to understand the excitement. — location: [4043](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4043) ^ref-2249

---
a New York Times article noted in a story about touch-tone phones and the new electronic switches.9 And the ESS enabled other options, such as call waiting or conference calling, that seemed promising, too. The New York Times noted that ESS allowed for the possibility that “a couple out for an evening of bridge will be able to have their calls switched automatically to their host’s home.” In other words, telephone customers could now move around—they could be mobile—and the system could still find them. Eventually, this would prove to be immensely valuable. — location: [4047](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4047) ^ref-46555

---
Bell Labs’ engineers had been encouraged by the public relations department to remark to journalists that ESS had the capacity “to provide services we haven’t even thought of yet.” It was a vague throwaway line that turned out to be exactly right. — location: [4052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4052) ^ref-20250

Second, the system would need to send more information digitally. Soon, Bell Labs engineers would put into place a system known as T-1 that used the pulse code modulation technique that Shannon and Pierce had long ago seen as the future. Instead of waves, transmission would consist of modulating voice signals transformed into on/off pulses that were effectively the same as the strings of 1s and 0s that guided the functions of computers. “The speech in each telephone channel,” Fisk said of PCM, “is sampled at a rate of 8,000 times per second and coded signals describing each sample are transmitted to the receiving terminal where the original speech is reconstructed.” — location: [4066](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4066) ^ref-14946

The third truth about the future was that the system would become more congested. Traffic— comprising voices, as phone subscriptions and calls continued to increase; data, as computers began conversing with one another over the phone wires; and video, as television and Picturephone devices became increasingly popular—would lead to overwhelming floods of information. How to accommodate it all? ESS would help. But ESS could only switch information and suggest a path, like a highly skilled traffic cop; you still needed to build pathways that were — location: [4073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4073) ^ref-57270

All forms of electronic communication use electromagnetic waves. And all electromagnetic waves have a place, classified by their length, on the electromagnetic spectrum. On one end are long waves—signals like the ones broadcast from huge antennas that project songs onto AM and FM radio stations. These undulating waves might measure several meters, or even hundreds of meters. Next come shorter waves whose lengths might only be measured in centimeters or millimeters. These wavelengths are commonly used for TV signals and radar. Generally speaking, the shorter the wavelength, the higher its frequency, and the more information it can carry. — location: [4080](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4080) ^ref-45142

---
By 1960, the Bell engineers believed that within a few decades it might be possible to send data over such wavelengths—in other words, to send data through light itself. If they could figure out how to do that, the system would be able to transmit an unimaginably huge amount of information. — location: [4092](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4092) ^ref-11646

BELL LABS’ vast plans for the future were two of Jim Fisk’s deputies, Julius Molnar and William Baker. Molnar, the Picturephone’s primary champion, believed that by the year 2000, “Picturephone will be the primary mode by which people will be communicating with one another.”11 — location: [4096](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4096) ^ref-16974

---
“Julius was extremely bright, extremely competent. But the thing about him was that he exuded power.” Indeed, those who knew Molnar believed that he knew more about the phone network and systems engineering than any person alive. “I can say, in front of any Bell Labs executive, without hurting anyone’s feelings, that Julius was the greatest executive at Bell Labs,” recalls Bill Fleckenstein, who worked under Molnar and eventually became the head of the Labs’ switching development division. “He knew more about what was going on at the Labs than any of several people put together. I liked Fisk very much. But the combination of Fisk, who didn’t know a lot about what was going on in the bowels of the place, and Julius, who knew everything about what was going on in the bowels of the place, was a good combination.” — location: [4104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4104) ^ref-63967

---
It was hard to say whether Bill Baker, the head of Bell Labs’ research division, knew what was going on in the bowels of the place. He did not, as a matter of course, tell people what he knew. He had nevertheless gathered a vast storehouse of information about Bell Labs’ operations. Every day at lunch he would sit down with the first person he spotted in the cafeteria, whether he was a glassblower from the vacuum tube shop or a metallurgist from the semiconductor lab—“Is it okay if I join you?” he would ask politely, never to be refused—and would gently interview the employee about his work and personal life and ideas. “At the end of any conversation,” Baker’s friend and colleague Mike Noll recalls, “you would then realize that he would know everything about you but you would know absolutely nothing about him.” — location: [4111](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4111) ^ref-48563

---
Colleagues often stood amazed that Baker could recall by name someone he had met only once, twenty or thirty years before. His mind wasn’t merely photographic, though; it worked in some ways like a switching apparatus: He tied everyone he ever met, and every conversation he ever had, into a complex and interrelated narrative of science and technology and society that he constantly updated, with apparent ease. — location: [4120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4120) ^ref-47538

---
Eventually they realized that when Baker showed modest enthusiasm—if something sounded very good to him—he didn’t particularly like it. “If he really liked something,” his colleague Irwin Dorros recalls, “then he would use about ten adjectives: that is a terrifically outstanding and superb contribution that has exceeded all expectations, or something like that.”15 As Ian Ross, who later became Baker’s deputy, and ultimately Bell Labs’ president, recalls, “The story Baker used to tell—not about himself, but it fitted him—was that there are two men sitting in a meeting where a man is making a presentation. And when the man finishes, one guy in the back turns to the other and says, ‘What was he talking about?’ And the other says, ‘I don’t know, he didn’t say.’ And that was Baker. He could speak for ten minutes and you hadn’t the vaguest idea of what he said. It was habitual. And I think it was willful. He wanted to obfuscate.”16 — location: [4143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4143) ^ref-55367

Other Bell Labs scientists would attribute their laboratory aptitude to their youthful efforts to take apart car engines or rebuild radios.

Materials, he would later say, represented “the grand alliance of engineering and science.”22 To Baker, chemistry was the discipline that made a global communications network feasible. He would often cite examples. By substituting the lead sheathing on telephone cables with a synthetic plastic created by Bell chemists, the Bell System saved “more than the total research budget of Bell Labs for the decade in which the innovation was worked out.”23 At one point Baker commissioned a study on the switch to plastic sheathing to satisfy his curiosity. The study concluded that the changeover saved the company about $2.5 billion. It also determined that if phone engineers had continued to sheathe telephone cable with lead, “it would require 80 percent of the total lead produced in the U.S.”24 — location: [4202](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4202) ^ref-38581

Pierce, in proposing why some research ideas could prove important, helped Baker perceive the future; Baker, in turn, ever enthusiastic about new knowledge and seeing Pierce as a tireless instigator of ideas, was willing to push for Pierce-driven efforts such as the Echo satellite or computer music. In Baker’s yearly reviews of Pierce—always suggesting the maximum raise possible—he characterized Pierce as a vital asset to Bell Labs, a scientist of international renown.28 — location: [4237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4237) ^ref-9296

The committee’s conclusions would be directed to the then five-year-old National Security Agency, a new unit within the Department of Defense charged with securing the country’s information networks and deciphering foreign intelligence.

The goal, as stated in Baker’s 1957 description of his committee, was “to search for new concepts of interconversion of information and intelligence.” In other words, his group would consider all the ways that technology now allowed information to be hidden and transmitted—through encoded signals, and even through chemical and biological patterns—and then recommend how America’s intelligence agencies might respond. — location: [4287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4287) ^ref-22642

More specifically, the Baker Committee sought insights into how the United States might develop the ability to crack any imaginable Soviet code. “Our history sustains the belief that for both the national security and the universal freedom of man,” Baker wrote, in a passage that held its own with the most artful cold war rhetoric, “the applications of all science to foreign deciphering political and military communications (basically revealing attitudes of nations toward each other) is a suitable and worthy intent.” — location: [4289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4289) ^ref-22636

“as you built more and more complicated devices, like switching systems, like computers, you got into millions of devices and millions of interconnections. So what should you do?” At Bell Labs, Jack Morton, the vice president of device development, had coined a name for the dilemma: “the tyranny of numbers.” — location: [4377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4377) ^ref-41458

---
Fewer components meant fewer interconnections. One way to do this, Morton thought, was to harness the physical properties of special semiconductors so that they might be made to perform multiple electronic tasks—turning them into a kind of electronic Swiss Army knife. Therefore “a simple thing” within a circuit could replace multiple components. Morton called these “functional devices,” but they were proving exceedingly difficult to engineer. — location: [4380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4380) ^ref-9748

Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild had different, better ideas. Both men, nearly simultaneously, came up with the idea of constructing all of the components in a circuit out of silicon, so that a complete circuit could exist within one piece—one chip—of semiconductor material. By eliminating the tyranny of interconnections, the method seemed to suggest substantial advantages in manufacturing and operational speed. Their innovation could, in short, be better and cheaper. — location: [4386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4386) ^ref-32426

To the engineers and scientists at the Labs, the integrated circuit was not a complete surprise. “We knew we could make multiple transistors within a piece of silicon, we knew we could make resistors, we knew we could make capacitors,” Ian Ross recalls.

At the very least, it proved that even the great technical minds at Bell Labs, Jack Morton especially, could misjudge the future. “We had all the elements to make an integrated circuit,” Tanenbaum adds. “And all the processes—diffusion, photolithography—were developed at Bell Labs.

THE LASER WAS NOT so much a single invention. Rather, it was the result of a storm of inventions during the 1960s.

John Pierce told an interviewer around that time. “You can’t clearly see that it will be of any use in communication. I mean, we certainly can’t guarantee that. But it has that potentiality.” Pierce added that “when something as closely related to signaling and communication as this comes along, and something is new and little understood, and you have the people who can do something about it, you’d just better do it, and worry later just about the details of why you went into it.” — location: [4458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4458) ^ref-51417

“He went around the world at that time, in 1960, trying to find good people—that’s all he wanted, good people,” recalls Herwig Kogelnik. “And then he would try to persuade them to switch their disciplines to take on what he called ‘laser and optical communications research.’” — location: [4463](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4463) ^ref-59970

Kogelnik was a plasma physicist, which meant he studied the physics of certain gases. Rudi Kompfner didn’t care. His simple argument to Kogelnik on the day they met was that the young man should think of the high frequency of light and what that could mean in terms of its capacity for information. Colleagues all recall the charm as well as the passion that animated Kompfner. To Kogelnik, he just said, “Think of all this bandwidth!”—a line that inspired Kogelnik to switch from plasma to lasers. “I had invested many, many years in plasma physics.

What was also attractive were the economics of optical transmission. For decades, the Bell System had realized that it was far more cost-efficient to mix together many hundreds of conversations on an intercity copper cable—by a complex technical means, the signals could be sent together at a higher frequency and then teased apart at the receiving ends. Sending more information and sending it more economically were often the same thing. — location: [4473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4473) ^ref-55902

There was, perhaps, another option. It was the idea of a scientist well outside the elite ranks of Bell Labs. In 1966, an engineer named Charles Kao, employed in England by International Telephone and Telegraph, visited the Labs to talk about a technology he was researching in Europe. Kao had recently delivered a paper at an engineering conference in London suggesting that transparent glass fibers, carrying waves of light, might solve the transmission problem. Some of the scientists at Bell Labs had already toyed with this possibility. It had long been clear to engineers that thin glass strands could transport light for short distances; such fibers, in fact, were already being used in medicine, where they were proving useful for gastrointestinal examinations. But those working in the communications field doubted that glass fibers could transport signals the much greater distances the phone system required. The glass just wasn’t clear enough. A signal would be lost—technically speaking, it would scatter and attenuate—after only a few dozen meters. Fibers were, as the engineers put it, too “lossy.” Kao was more optimistic. He had spent the past few years in Europe doing deep exploratory research, and he had determined there was no fundamental reason why strands of exceedingly pure glass couldn’t carry signals substantial distances. His paper was partly theoretical. Glass of the sort Kao was talking about didn’t really exist; even the clearest glass on earth would effectively absorb or scatter light and thus kill a signal in a few dozen meters. But Kao hadn’t said that pure glass would replace wires or waveguides immediately. He had only concluded it was possible. He was also liberated to some extent from the pressures that shaped the views of the Bell Labs scientists. Labs upper management had bet the future on waveguides, but Kao had not. — location: [4493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4493) ^ref-14523

Phone engineers in Europe—Kao included—weren’t looking for a complex new technology, such as the waveguide, for intercity communication. They needed intracity communication.

The integrated circuit of Kilby and Noyce, which built on the engineering and materials-science achievements of Bell Labs, seemed more a missed opportunity than a misstep.28 But nobody could offer such a mitigating rationale to explain the waveguide and Picturephone, two interrelated and fabulously expensive follies.29 It seems worth considering not only how those endeavors failed, but what those failures represented. Innovators make different kinds of mistakes. The waveguide, for instance, might be considered a mistake of perception. It was an instance where a technology of legitimate promise is eclipsed by a breakthrough elsewhere—in another corporate department, at another company, at a university, wherever—that solves a particular problem better. It was perhaps understandable, moreover, that a breakthrough in the creation of pure glass fibers wouldn’t come from an organization such as Bell Labs, where materials scientists were experts on the behaviors of metals, polymers, and semiconductor crystals. Rather, it would come from a company like Corning, with over a century of expertise in glass and ceramics. — location: [4561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4561) ^ref-12958

Mistakes of perception are not the same as mistakes of judgment, though. In the latter, an idea that developers think will satisfy a need or want does not. It may prove useless because of its functional shortcomings, or because it’s too expensive in relation to its modest appeal, or because it arrives in the marketplace too early or too late. Or because of all those reasons combined. The Picturephone was a mistake in judgment. — location: [4570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4570) ^ref-903

For years, Bell Labs executives in Murray Hill, Holmdel, and Whippany had communicated with one another via Picturephones in their offices. “I used it all the time,” Dorros recalls. “I used it every day. I thought it was terrific.” Not all the directors and vice presidents, however, liked the service. Rudi Kompfner, for instance, positioned a still photograph of himself in front of his set—in John Pierce’s admiring recollection, the image showed Kompfner to be remarkably attentive and invariably interested in whatever was being said—so that he could move about his office during a chat. — location: [4619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=4619) ^ref-8708

In the view of Ross and others, such efforts probably helped delay a variety of antitrust actions. Ross recalls, “Kelly set up Sandia Labs, which was run by AT&T, managed by us, and whenever I asked, ‘Why do we stay with this damn thing, it’s not our line of business,’ the answer was, ‘It helps us if we get into an antitrust suit.’ And Bell Labs did work on military programs.

As he saw it, though, Corning was still ahead of Bell Labs. “The progress made with optical fibers” at the Labs was outstanding, he noted, but it was not in the “breakthrough” class like Corning’s.17 Kompfner’s main advantage was that Bell Labs could throw almost unlimited amounts of talent and money at a problem, especially when solving it had such tantalizing potential.

More to the point, the thrust of the work at Bell Labs seemed to have shifted decisively to big projects involving hundreds of people.

It was Engel’s understanding that to get ahead at Bell Labs, “you were supposed to work on more than you were asked to work on.”6 It was necessary, in other words, not only to do your assigned work but to devote 20 or 30 percent of your time to another project. — location: [5009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5009) ^ref-26328

At the time Engel was assigned to work on Bell Labs’ paging systems; AT&T was now selling a bulky, bricklike box, known as “Bell Boy,” that doctors or other busy professional people could use to alert them with a buzz that someone had called them.

Indeed, to stroll around inside the Black Box at that time, one would not have imagined that a mobile telephone system was an on-ramp to the future. The thing about Bell Labs, Frenkiel remarks, was that it could spend millions of dollars—or even $100 million, which was what AT&T would spend on cellular before it went to market7—on a technology that offered little guarantee it would succeed technologically or economically. Indeed, a marketing study commissioned by AT&T in the fall of 1971 informed its team that “there was no market for mobile phones at any price.” Neither man agreed with that assessment. — location: [5030](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5030) ^ref-2140

He would later look back and see the early 1970s as a perfect example of what engineers sometimes call “steam engine time.” This term refers to the Scottish engineer James Watt, the inventor of the first commercially popular steam engine, whose name is also memorialized in the term we use to measure power. In the late 1700s, Watt made startling improvements upon more basic ideas of how to use compressed steam to run heavy machinery. The knowledge needed to make such an engine had by then coalesced to the point that his innovation was, arguably, inevitable. By the 1970s, the mobile business was ready to happen, Engel was sure, even if the marketers had their doubts. The technology was there. It was now just a matter of who was going to do it, and how fast they could make it work. “It was,” he says, “steam engine time for cellular.” The FCC’s decision to consider proposals for mobile radio had been the spark. But a number of other technologies made it steam engine time, too. — location: [5044](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5044) ^ref-3357

“Cellular is a computer technology,” Frenkiel points out. “It’s not a radio technology.” In other words, engineering the transmission and reception from a mobile handset to the local antennas, while challenging, wasn’t what made the idea innovative. It was the system’s logic—locating a user moving through the cellular honeycomb, monitoring the signal strength of that call, and handing off a call to a new channel, and a new antenna tower, as a caller moves along. — location: [5053](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5053) ^ref-50425

the ESS was invented to be a central office switch, meaning it was created to simply direct calls between landline phones.8 “But it’s sitting there and it’s got the ability to be programmed for something no one ever expected it to do—all those instantaneous decisions that were never necessary. And now we come along to say we need to do locating and handoffs. And also, by the way, we need to keep track of the health of every base station in the system, we need trouble reports, we need to gather data for traffic.” The ESS—a switching system with a powerful computer embedded within it—could do all these things. — location: [5072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5072) ^ref-42946

Should a cellular phone have a dial tone? Porter made a radical suggestion that it shouldn’t. A caller should dial a number and then push “send.” That way, the mobile caller would be less rushed; also, the call would be connected for a shorter time, thus putting less strain on the network. That this idea—dial, then send—would later prove crucial to texting technology was not even considered. — location: [5152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5152) ^ref-11564

To Drucker, telecommunications was now just a part of the immense field of information and electronic technology. There were many competitors and many competing ideas in this field. And therefore, going forward, no single lab could on its own provide the new technology for the entire electronics and information industry.

one thing about Kelly impressed him above all else: It had to do with how his former boss would advise members of Bell Labs’ technical staff when they were asked to work on something new. Whether it was a radar technology for the military or solid-state research for the phone company, Kelly did not want to begin a project by focusing on what was known. He would want to begin by focusing on what was not known. As Pierce explained, the approach was both difficult and counterintuitive. It was more common practice, at least in the military, to proceed with what technology would allow and fill in the gaps afterward.

There are varying explanations as to why Shockley became fixated on genetics and race. Some former colleagues speculate that a serious car accident in the early 1960s may have led indirectly to changes in cognition. It’s worth asking, however, whether Shockley’s fixation was merely an accentuation of beliefs he had long harbored. Fred Seitz, who accompanied Shockley on a cross-country car trip in 1932 from California to the East Coast, remarked that even as a young man, Shockley was warm to the idea that intellectual superiority should be rewarded with authority and influence. “He was inclined to believe that society should be governed by what one might regard as an intellectually elite group . . . rather than by majority decisions as in a democratic society.”12 Shockley maintained a heightened interest in IQ scores all through his life. He would become notorious for screening some of the applicants at Shockley Semiconductor, in 1956 and 1957, through psychological and intelligence tests.

In fact it was only a temporary setback. In Shockley’s case, the leap from his early question (How does intelligence translate into scientific creativity?) to his later question (How do genes influence intelligence?) was not especially controversial. But then came a more precarious leap: How does race determine intelligence? It was likely the case, as some of Shockley’s former colleagues contend, that he didn’t begin his effort out of any deep-seated bigotry. But it is almost certainly true that Shockley’s sensitivity to rejection led him in that direction. — location: [5412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5412) ^ref-64890

Almost certainly the dinner conversation exemplified how Shockley seized every moment that he was not at the Bell Labs offices as an opportunity to discuss eugenics. The agreement he had struck with Morton stipulated that he would refrain from mixing his racial theories, which he pursued most of the year out of his home in California, with his development work at Bell Labs. It soon became clear, however, that Shockley could barely abide by such an agreement. Indeed, after only a few years of consulting work at the Labs, he asked to scale back. Dysgenics was now his actual career; the main thrust of Shockley’s life from 1970 on was to attract attention to the idea. — location: [5455](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5455) ^ref-48468

The great tragedy of Bill Shockley’s life, Ian Ross remarks, was that he did almost nothing of scientific worth after leaving Bell Labs. Arguably, his successes were as a teacher and as an impresario of talent—that is, in assembling the team at Shockley Semiconductor that ultimately drove the success of America’s computer chip industry. “Had he stayed in that environment,” Ross says of Bell Labs, “it would have been a very different story.” With a larger enveloping group, in other words—with a slew of supervisors who understood how to compensate for his weaknesses, and a veritable army of technicians who could prepare semiconductor materials to exacting specifications—Shockley might not have been overcome by his poor management skills and defective judgment. — location: [5478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5478) ^ref-17452

As Pierce saw it, the great laboratories of the twentieth century had a clear purpose: “Someone depended on them for something, and was anxious to get it. They were really needed, and they rose to the need.” For Bell Labs, Pierce noted, the need was modern communications. That future rested upon the institution and the researchers who worked there. Pierce was now watching “as an interested onlooker” to see if the new AT&T Bell Laboratories could figure out a new mission, a new purpose. He wasn’t skeptical; he believed it was indeed possible. But he wasn’t terribly optimistic, either. The old world was already gone, he explained, it was just that most people hadn’t yet noticed. “It is just plain silly,” he wrote, “to identify the new AT&T Bell Laboratories with the old Bell Telephone Laboratories just because the new Laboratories has inherited buildings, equipment and personnel from the old. The mission was absolutely essential to the research done at the old Laboratories, and that mission is gone and has not been replaced.”2 • — location: [5791](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5791) ^ref-34788

As wireless phone services boomed, and as the Internet exploded in popularity, so, too, did the need for telecommunications equipment in the United States and abroad.

Just two years after it split from AT&T, Lucent’s stock valuation— $98.5 billion—was higher than its onetime parent. — location: [5855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=5855) ^ref-18338

The scientific press nevertheless mourned the pragmatic turn the Labs had taken. When Nature, the esteemed British science magazine, discovered that only four researchers were now working in basic physics at the Labs, it ran an article entitled “Bell Labs Bottoms Out.”10 Meanwhile, grown men who had worked at Bell Labs during its golden age would sometimes confess to driving by the Murray Hill complex and experiencing an emotion close to bereavement.

whether they would perceive them as paths to the future, as many economic commentators often do.

But Kelly believed the most valuable ideas arose when the large group of physicists bumped against other departments and disciplines, too. “It’s the interaction between fundamental science and applied science, and the interface between many disciplines, that creates new ideas,” explains Herwig Kogelnik, the laser scientist.

It became increasingly difficult to fund basic research; instead, Bell Labs had to focus more on development and engineering. The Labs also needed a narrower focus on products and short- or medium-term goals.

Eugene Kleiner, moreover, a founding partner at the premier venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, was originally hired by Bill Shockley at his ill-fated semiconductor company. But the Silicon Valley process that Kleiner helped develop was a different innovation model from Bell Labs. It was not a factory of ideas; it was a geography of ideas. It was not one concentrated and powerful machine; it was the meshing of many interlocking small parts grouped physically near enough to one another so as to make an equally powerful machine. — location: [6040](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6040) ^ref-24418

The hope was that Terman might be able to map out an innovation hub for New Jersey, based in part around the technological excellence of Bell Labs. One seemingly insoluble problem was that New Jersey was too geographically diffuse for the Palo Alto model to work there. The universities that did exist, such as Princeton and Rutgers, were either too far away from one another or too theoretical in their scientific focus to act as fertile training grounds for East Coast entrepreneurs. What’s more, while Bell Labs was dynamic—the scientists and engineers there shared ideas and knowledge with one another and, to a certain extent, with their friends in the academy and other industrial labs—it was not as dynamic as Silicon Valley.12 In the Valley, engineers changed jobs constantly while companies formed and dissolved and then formed again, as if in constant agitation. — location: [6049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6049) ^ref-1127

turned out that funding the school would be expensive—Terman projected a start-up cost of $15 million, according to the management historian Stephen B. Adams. The pharmaceutical industries were not interested, which meant that Bell Labs would have to be the main backer.13 It was too difficult for Baker to justify the costs. And ultimately, Summit University, along with the Terman study, was shelved. — location: [6058](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6058) ^ref-15458

Perhaps the only thing lacking is that venture firms are averse, understandably, to funding an entrepreneur seeking out new and fundamental knowledge. Without any way to predict the difficulty of obtaining new knowledge, and without any tools to assess its market value, how could someone bet money on it?

While it is frequently the case that new knowledge can arise from academia or a government laboratory and then secure venture capital afterward, it seems a more difficult proposition in Silicon Valley than it was long ago in New Jersey.

John Pierce did not flatter himself so much as to think that success in basic or applied research—those big leaps in scientific knowledge—were necessarily more heroic than development. “You see, out of fourteen people in the Bell Laboratories,” he once remarked, “only one is in the Research Department, and that’s because pursuing an idea takes, I presume, fourteen times as much effort as having it.” — location: [6074](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6074) ^ref-23364

So if you hear something negative about how John Pierce managed people, I’d say, well, that’s not surprising. Pierce wasn’t about managing people. Pierce was about managing ideas. And you cannot manage ideas and manage people the same way. It just doesn’t work.

“Pierce did not let people get in the way of his pursuit of ideas,” Mayo adds. “He did not compromise because it would make people feel good. He did his thing because he felt it was necessary to accomplish the development of ideas the way he wanted. He was excellent at that. And I loved those research people for that. They weren’t about making people feel good. They were about motivating people—not to do the conventional thing, but to do the unconventional thing.” — location: [6085](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6085) ^ref-1573

To follow the progress of business now, Mayo adds, is to become accustomed to watching successful technology companies offer new engineers rich incentives for their work. Pierce and Bell Labs couldn’t do that because they were funded like a public utility. But they also couldn’t do that because it chafed against their belief in how innovations arise. “Incentives are fine,” Mayo says, “but they produce incremental improvements in what’s there. — location: [6088](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6088) ^ref-19268

Strangely enough, however, it may not have been in Mervin Kelly or in some of his disciples—perhaps because the monopoly, at least for a time, guaranteed that the phone company’s business would remain sturdy even in the face of drastic technological upheaval. Kelly, for instance, who toiled for decades to improve and perfect the vacuum tube, effectively lobbied for a research program on the transistor that, when it succeeded, rendered his entire previous career in science irrelevant. — location: [6096](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6096) ^ref-56471

But the problem Pierce wrestled with that day was how to decouple Bell Labs’ success from its circumstances. “Bell Labs functioned in a world not ours,” he noted. The links between government and business were different in that era; the monopoly was deemed acceptable as well as vital. And the compensation scale for its researchers and managers could never suffice in the modern economy. In Pierce’s era, the top officer at Bell Labs made about twelve times that of the lowest-paid worker; — location: [6108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6108) ^ref-28825

Pierce, to put it simply, was asking himself: What about Bell Labs’ formula was timeless? In his 1997 list, he thought it boiled down to four things: A technically competent management all the way to the top. Researchers didn’t have to raise funds. Research on a topic or system could be and was supported for years. Research could be terminated without damning the researcher.17 — location: [6125](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6125) ^ref-529

The fact that the telephone engineers faced an unceasing stream of technical and logistical problems always urged them toward innovative solutions. Without question, the size of the staff at Bell Labs, and its interdisciplinary nature, were large factors in its success, too. So was the steadiness of the Labs’ funding stream, guaranteed by the monthly bill paid by phone subscribers, which effectively allowed the organization to function much like a national laboratory. Bell Labs managers knew they could support projects—the undersea cable, for example, or cellular telephony—that might require decades of work. The funding stream also assured the managers that they could consistently support educational programs to improve the staff’s expertise and capabilities. — location: [6132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6132) ^ref-61828

Bell Labs’ sense of mission—to plan the future of communications—also had an incalculable value that endured for sixty years. The mission was broad but also directed.

It also suggests that we tend to misinterpret the value of markets. What seems more likely, as the science writer Steven Johnson has noted in a broad study of scientific innovations, is that creative environments that foster a rich exchange of ideas are far more important in eliciting important new insights than are the forces of competition.18 Indeed, one might concede that market competition has been superb at giving consumers incremental and appealing improvements. But that does not mean it has been good at prompting huge advances (such as those at Bell Labs, as well as those that allowed for the creation of the Internet, for instance, or, even earlier, antibiotics). It’s the latter types that pay to society the biggest and most lasting dividends. — location: [6143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6143) ^ref-37507

knowledge of the things and methods of science.” As he saw it, a properly staffed and organized lab could avoid the mistakes of cut-and-try experimentation and in turn “bring to bear an aggregate of creative force on any particular problem which is infinitely greater than any force which can be conceived of as residing in the intellectual capacity of an individual.” — location: [6162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6162) ^ref-31756

In Lucky’s view, the exceptional individuals lent the institution its reputation of exceptionalism. “I just don’t think they make people like the kind of people we had,” Lucky says. “Not that nature doesn’t make them, just that the environment doesn’t make them. We had these people who were bigger than life back then. And we don’t seem to have them anymore—though people might say Steve Jobs or Bill Gates.” In Lucky’s view, a list of Bell Labs’ exemplars captures the essence of the organization. “They set the examples that permeated the whole place. They created the fame and were what other people aspired to be. They were the leaders, even if they weren’t high up in management. If you knew them, you knew Bell Labs.” While it’s true that the handful of famous people overshadows tens of thousands of other people, he adds, if you take that handful away, “you don’t have Bell Labs.” — location: [6239](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6239) ^ref-6218

To him, the essence of Bell Labs was its immense and complete institutional capabilities—how it could develop anything from the tiniest element of a small electronic device to the grand plan for a national network; also, how it could develop people, turning callow college graduates into competent researchers and managers.

John Pierce, the most eloquent of the Young Turks, seemed to have a deep respect for the destructive quality of new technology. Pierce carried this understanding with him from his youth until his death. Upon receiving the Japan Prize in the mid-1980s, he wrote, “However nostalgic I may be about the world of my childhood, it is gone, and so are the sorts of people who lived in it. Science and technology destroyed that world and replaced it with another.” — location: [6264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6264) ^ref-25463

It is clear that we build for the day and not for the ages, and what we build has a community and functional rather than an individual character.”26 There was no way around the conclusion. Pierce and his friends were making ideas and things that would either disappear in an instant, or would be absorbed into the ongoing project of civilization. He feared that any memories of the makers would perish, too. “I am afraid that there will be little tangible left in a later age,” Pierce wrote of his world at Bell Labs, “to remind our heirs that we were men, rather than cogs in a machine.” — location: [6277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GSZIWG&location=6277) ^ref-62266
