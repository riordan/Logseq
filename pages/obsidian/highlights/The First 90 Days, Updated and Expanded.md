## Highlights
transitions are also periods of acute vulnerability, because you lack established working relationships and a detailed understanding of your new role. — location: [149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=149) ^ref-2018

---
You’re managing under a microscope, subject to a high degree of scrutiny as people around you strive to figure out who you are and what you represent — location: [150](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=150) ^ref-48118

---
you’re successful in building credibility and securing early wins, the momentum likely will propel you through the rest of your tenure. — location: [152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=152) ^ref-26562

---
Your goal in every transition is to get as rapidly as possible to the break-even point. This is the point at which you have contributed as much value to your new organization as you have consumed from it. — location: [176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=176) ^ref-29999

---
success in the new role requires you to stop doing some things and to embrace new competencies. — location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=200) ^ref-14420

---
You are too busy to learn, and you make bad decisions and catalyze resistance to your initiatives. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=203) ^ref-63055

---
You don’t negotiate your mandate or establish clear, achievable objectives. — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=204) ^ref-26086

You rush off in all directions, launching multiple initiatives in the hope that some will pay off. People become confused, and no critical mass of resources gets focused on key initiatives. — location: [206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=206) ^ref-39932

You alienate people who could help you understand what’s going — location: [209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=209) ^ref-33079

---
You don’t build the cultural insight, relationships, and information conduits you need if you’re to understand what is really going on. — location: [212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=212) ^ref-60638

---
You spend too much time focused on vertical relationships—up to the boss and down to direct reports—and not enough on peers and other stakeholders. You don’t fully understand what it will take to succeed, and you miss early opportunities to build supportive alliances. — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=214) ^ref-22927

---
enmeshes its victims in a vicious cycle (see figure I-2). By failing to learn the right things in the right ways at the outset, for example, you can make bad initial decisions that damage your credibility. Then, because people don’t trust your judgment, it can become still more difficult to learn what you need to know. You consume energy compensating for early miscalculations, and the downward spiral takes hold. — location: [220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=220) ^ref-15263

---
you need to create virtuous cycles that help you create momentum and establish an upward spiral of increasing effectiveness (see figure I-3). Good initial decisions founded on the right kind of learning, for example, bolster your personal credibility. As people come to trust your judgment, your ability to learn accelerates, and you equip yourself to make sound calls on tougher issues. — location: [224](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=224) ^ref-55155

Prepare yourself. This means making a mental break from your old job and preparing to take charge in the new one. — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=249) ^ref-6949

The dangers of sticking with what you know, working extremely hard at doing it, and failing miserably are very real. — location: [251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=251) ^ref-52907

---
In the first few weeks, you need to identify opportunities to build personal credibility. In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results that will help you get to the break-even point more rapidly. — location: [260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=260) ^ref-8856

Negotiate success. Because no other single relationship is more important, you need to figure out how to build a productive working relationship with your new boss (or bosses) and manage her expectations. — location: [262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=262) ^ref-43316

The risks of losing perspective, becoming isolated, and making bad calls are ever present during transitions. — location: [276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=276) ^ref-59057

you need to help all those in your organization—direct reports, bosses, and peers—accelerate their own transitions. — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=278) ^ref-57534

Often, promising managers fail in new roles because they’ve failed to prepare themselves by embracing the necessary changes in perspective. — location: [373](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=373) ^ref-4829

---
You also need to learn to strike the right balance between keeping the wide view and drilling down into the details. This juggling act can be challenging, because what had been the fifty-thousand-foot view in your previous role may be equivalent to the world at five thousand feet, or even five hundred feet, in your new job. — location: [384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=384) ^ref-28077

Rethink What You Delegate — location: [387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=387) ^ref-31658

---
the keys to effective delegation remain much the same: you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process. — location: [389](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=389) ^ref-50375

---
If you’re leading an organization of five people, it may make sense to delegate specific tasks such as drafting a piece of marketing material or selling to a particular customer. — location: [392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=392) ^ref-35136

your ability to identify “right” answers based solely on data and analysis declines correspondingly.

Are executives in particular roles given lots of decision-making power from Day 1, or is the degree of authority a function of seniority? Or does the organization operate according to consensus, where the ability to persuade is key?

Conflict. Can people talk openly about difficult issues without fear of retribution? Or do they avoid conflict—or, even worse, push it to lower levels, where it can wreak havoc? — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=535) ^ref-35582

Ends versus means. Are there any restrictions on how you achieve results? Does the organization have a well-defined, well-communicated set of values that is reinforced through positive and negative incentives? — location: [537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=537) ^ref-48253

---
you have been hired from the outside, ask for help in identifying and connecting with key stakeholders or finding a cultural interpreter. These people often are natural historians who can give you insight into how the organization has evolved and changed. — location: [683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=683) ^ref-17153

baseline question you always should ask is, “How did we get to this point?” Otherwise, you risk tearing down existing structures or processes without knowing why they were put there in the first place. — location: [740](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=740) ^ref-12680

---
the pressure to “do” almost always comes more from inside the leader than from outside forces; it reflects a lack of confidence and a consequent need to prove yourself. Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence. — location: [745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=745) ^ref-4439

being too busy to learn results in a death spiral. If, like Chris, you do not focus on learning, you can easily make poor early decisions that undermine your credibility, alienate potential supporters, and make people less likely to share important information with you. — location: [748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=748) ^ref-19730

In turnarounds, leaders are often dealing with people who are hungry for hope, vision, and direction, and that necessitates a heroic style of leadership—charging against the enemy, sword in hand. People line up behind the hero in times of trouble and follow commands. The premium is on rapid diagnosis of the business situation (markets, technologies, products, strategies) and then aggressive moves to cut back the organization to a defensible core. You need to act quickly and decisively, often on the basis of incomplete information. — location: [1197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1197) ^ref-42297

---
Realignments, in contrast, demand from leaders something more akin to stewardship or servant leadership—a more diplomatic and less ego-driven approach that entails building consensus for the need for change. More subtle influence skills come into play; skilled stewards have deep understandings of the culture and politics of their organizations. Stewards are more patient and systematic than heroes in deciding which people, processes, and other resources to preserve and which to discard. They also painstakingly cultivate awareness of the need for change by promoting shared diagnosis, influencing opinion leaders, and encouraging benchmarking. — location: [1203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1203) ^ref-50527

This was the misdiagnosis of Brown, Mapzen, and ctf.

First, he needed to stock his team with some natural stewards to whom he could turn for wise counsel (lest he go off half-cocked) and to whom he could delegate some of the necessary outreach. Second, he had to identify where it actually made sense to focus some of his heroic energies. — location: [1220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1220) ^ref-26933

when it came to preferences, the pattern reversed, with start-up being (by far) the most popular, followed by turnaround and accelerated growth. This is not a surprising finding, and the underlying reasons are revealing. It is not the case that people are drawn to the easy situations. Rather, they are drawn to situations that are (1) more fun and (2) get more recognition. — location: [1230](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1230) ^ref-42106

Few high-potential leaders show much interest in realignments, preferring the action and recognition associated with turnarounds (and start-ups). — location: [1262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1262) ^ref-34762

What are the implications for your learning agenda? Do you need to understand only the technical side of the business, or is it critical that you understand culture and politics as well? — location: [1281](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1281) ^ref-40666

“I want to operate on a 90-day time frame, starting with 30 days to get on top of things,” he told her. “Then I will bring you a detailed assessment and plan with goals and actions for the next 60 days.” — location: [1294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1294) ^ref-29633

Don’t surprise your boss. It’s no fun bringing your boss bad news. However, most bosses consider it a far greater sin not to report emerging problems early enough. Worst of all is for your boss to learn about a problem from someone else. It’s usually best to give your new boss at least a heads-up as soon as you become aware of a developing problem. — location: [1330](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1330) ^ref-18423

Don’t approach your boss only with problems. That said, you don’t want to be perceived as bringing nothing but problems for your boss to solve. You also need to have plans for how you will proceed. — location: [1332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1332) ^ref-5821

Don’t run down your checklist. There is a tendency, even for senior leaders, to use meetings with a boss as an opportunity to run through your checklist of what you’ve been doing. — location: [1338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1338) ^ref-39996

Don’t expect your boss to change. You and your new boss may have very different working styles. You may communicate in different ways, motivate in different ways, and prefer different levels of detail in overseeing your direct reports. But it’s your responsibility to adapt to your boss’s style; you need to adapt your approach to work with your boss’s preferences. — location: [1342](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1342) ^ref-50145

---
Clarify expectations early and often. Begin managing expectations from the moment you consider taking a new role. Focus on expectations during the interview process. You are in trouble if your boss expects you to fix things fast when you know the business has serious structural problems. It’s wise to get bad news on the table early and to lower unrealistic expectations. — location: [1346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1346) ^ref-34507

Take 100 percent responsibility for making the relationship work. This is the flip side of “Don’t stay away.” Don’t expect your boss to reach out or to offer you the time and support you need. It’s best to begin by assuming that it’s on your shoulders to make the relationship work. If your boss meets you partway, it will be a welcome surprise. — location: [1351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1351) ^ref-64273

Negotiate time lines for diagnosis and action planning. Don’t let yourself get caught up immediately in firefighting or be pressured to make calls before you’re ready. — location: [1353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1353) ^ref-13203

Take the time to formulate a plan. And actually haave the cajones to stick through it. Though having a  team along side me will most certainly help.

Try to put yourself in his shoes and understand how his boss will evaluate him. Figure out how you fit into the larger picture. Above all, don’t let key issues remain ambiguous. Ambiguity about goals and expectations is dangerous. A tie in a conflict over what was said about expectations in an earlier conversation doesn’t go to you. It goes to your boss. — location: [1473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1473) ^ref-34136

realignment situations, you need consistent, public backing to get the organization to confront the need for change.

decide what resources—tangible and intangible—you must have to succeed. Identify the resources already available to you, such as experienced people or new products ready to be launched. Then identify the resources you will need help in obtaining. Ask yourself, “What exactly do I need from my boss?” The sooner you can articulate the resources you need, the sooner you can broach these requests. — location: [1487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1487) ^ref-34290

Your 90-day plan should be written, even if it consists only of bullet points. It should specify priorities and goals as well as milestones. Critically, you should share it with your boss and seek buy-in for it. It should serve as a “contract” between the two of you about how you’re going to spend your time, spelling out both what you will do and what you will not do. — location: [1590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1590) ^ref-65492

Your key outputs at the end of the first 30 days will be a diagnosis of the situation, an identification of key priorities, and a plan for how you will spend the next 30 days.

At the 60-day mark, your review meeting should focus on assessing your progress toward the goals of your plan for the previous 30 days. You should also discuss what you plan to achieve in the next 30 days (that is, by the end of 90 days). Depending on the situation and your level in the organization, your goals at this juncture might include identifying the resources necessary to pursue major initiatives, fleshing out your initial assessments of strategy and structure, and presenting some early assessments of your team. — location: [1601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1601) ^ref-1366

Following an early period of focused learning, these leaders begin an early wave of changes. The pace then slows to allow consolidation and deeper learning about the organization, and to allow people to catch their breath. Armed with more insight, these executives then implement deeper waves of change. A final, less extreme wave focuses on fine-tuning to maximize performance. — location: [1665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=1665) ^ref-55709
