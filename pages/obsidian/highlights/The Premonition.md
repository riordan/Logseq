## Highlights
The ICU also grabbed his attention, and kept it. “I loved it,” he said. “The alarms would go off, and it was like someone gave me Ritalin. Everything else is cut out and I can see the problem. I felt like I was my best when the shit hits the fan. I focus like a laser when everything is going to shit.” — location: [893](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=893) ^ref-34127

---
There was this other thing he liked, too—the feelings the ICU left you with. If you didn’t allow yourself to become numb, the place kept you alive to the complexity of life, and its sanctity. — location: [896](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=896) ^ref-11716

“Didn’t you stick a needle in her chest?” Carter asked, then regretted having asked it. The guy was a mess. He knew he’d choked. He’d asked for an X-ray so he could see what was happening inside the woman’s chest. By the time he had the picture, and the comfort of certainty, she was dead. “We used to tell ourselves, ‘You’re going to make a mistake,’ ” said Carter. “The sin is making the same mistake twice. The best is to learn from other people’s mistakes.” — location: [925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=925) ^ref-54607

The Veterans Health Administration treated a quarter of a million Americans a day: it was the second-largest provider of medical care in the world, behind the UK’s National Health Service. — location: [949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=949) ^ref-28397

Carter was fielding calls from various people to let him know that the system he oversaw had boiled someone alive. The nurses were devastated, but to Carter’s way of thinking they were victims, too. The environment in which they worked, and which they had been encouraged to trust, had failed them. “When you go into the details of the cases, you see it’s not bad people,” he said. “It’s bad systems. When the systems depend on human vigilance, they will fail.” — location: [988](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=988) ^ref-44802

---
He now had a rule: if you visit a hospital to investigate some problem, visit more than once, as on the first visit the locals assume that you have come merely to find fault and assign blame rather than to enlist them as partners in the hunt for the flaw in the system. He’d learned that from some field anthropologists whom he had sought out. “They taught me how important it was to have a second visit when they visited villages,” said Carter. “The second visit made a statement to the villagers, and it usually wasn’t until the second visit that trust emerged.” — location: [997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=997) ^ref-34862

---
He made a point of asking questions in plain English, and less in the manner of a doctor than a child. Why do you do it this way? Can you show me how you do that? Putting things simply made it easier to ask important questions that, if put in doctor-speak, might sound silly. — location: [1002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1002) ^ref-53569

“I was allowing them to open the curtain and take a look. You see so much. If people would just spend their time and observe. You don’t need any advanced degrees.” — location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1005) ^ref-10671

---
He was struck especially by Reason’s argument that the best way to guard against error is to design systems with layered and overlapping defenses. There was an image of Reason’s that Carter loved, of slices of Swiss cheese being layered on top of one another, until there were no holes you could see through. — location: [1026](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1026) ^ref-19920

---
So, while running a bunch of hospitals, he was also now making himself expert in all sorts of seemingly irrelevant subjects. Aviation safety, for instance. Whenever two planes almost collided, the Federal Aviation Administration knew about it and investigated. But when a nurse screwed up and gave a patient medications intended for another, no one made a note of it unless the patient died. — location: [1031](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1031) ^ref-32524

---
He felt strongly that Veterans Affairs should attack the mistakes that happened inside its hospitals in a more systematic way, by scouring the system for almost mistakes. Near misses. — location: [1035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1035) ^ref-41372

“It was the natural place to explore medical error, because unlike a similar situation in the private sector, you can’t hide it,” — location: [1036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1036) ^ref-22591

Never forget that some government institutions can bend the rules of business physics.

The gist of it was that people don’t learn what is imposed upon them but rather what they freely seek, out of desire or need. For people to learn, they need to want to learn. — location: [1061](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1061) ^ref-5711

an argument for creating, inside the VA, a new kind of institution that he called a Learning Exchange. “People in an organization learn,” said Carter. “They’re learning all kinds of things. But they aren’t learning what you are teaching them. You go to a formal meeting. The important conversation is not in the meeting. It’s in the halls during the breaks. And usually what’s important is taboo. And you can’t say it in the formal meeting.” He was trying, among other things, to create ways to admit the conversation from the hallways into the formal meeting. — location: [1072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1072) ^ref-52437

People who complained about “government waste” usually fixated on the ways taxpayer money got spent. But here was the real waste. One box might contain the solution to a problem in another box, or the person who might find that solution, and that second box would never know about it. — location: [1161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1161) ^ref-62255

---
To illustrate this point he created a picture, of a 2,600-square-foot home, but with the same population density as an American school, then turned it into a slide. “The Spacing of People, If Homes Were Like Schools,” read the top. The inside of the typical American single-family home suddenly looked a lot like a refugee prison, or the DMV on a bad day. — location: [1356](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1356) ^ref-58172

“Imagine if we could affect the weather,” Carter wrote, in one of his long memos. “Imagine if we had the capability to reduce a category 5 storm to a category 2 or a 1 . . . Now although the Federal Government is not at the threshold of significantly reducing the potency of a hurricane, it is at the threshold of doing just this to another natural disaster—pandemic influenza.” — location: [1360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1360) ^ref-17510

---
Richard began to deliver talks to small groups of important people about the way the model confirmed their hunch that there were things you could do to buy time before a vaccine. He’d coined a phrase for their strategy: Targeted Layered Containment. TLC. — location: [1363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1363) ^ref-33590

The hammer and the dance

---
At some point Richard and Carter realized that they’d need to change the minds of everyone working in and around public health, and that this meant first changing people’s minds inside the Centers for Disease Control. — location: [1383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1383) ^ref-17268

But there had been a reason Rajeev hadn’t asked the CDC to join the team creating a new pandemic strategy. Whatever strategy the White House dreamed up would necessarily be original, he thought, and the people who already saw themselves as experts in the field would be least capable of original thought. They’d be constrained by their sense that they already knew everything worth knowing about disease control, and would be threatened by the possibility that in fact they did not. And that might have been true. But it created a tension between these two doctors who were making it up as they went along and the people who regarded themselves as the world’s authorities on disease control. — location: [1386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1386) ^ref-51309

---
There’d been one final chapter to write, on how to keep big institutions, public and private, running during a pandemic. Somehow everyone on the team had agreed that it needed to be written into the plan, without anyone’s agreeing to write it. One day Rajeev stopped by and asked Carter about what everyone now just referred to as “chapter nine.” “There’s nothing in chapter nine,” Carter said. “You write it,” said Rajeev. “I don’t know shit about it,” said Carter. “Write it anyway,” said Rajeev. “No one else knows anything, either.” — location: [1392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1392) ^ref-21237

She saw that the White House document had been passed down, rung by rung, inside the CDC by people who didn’t want to deal with it, until it had finally, and a bit surprisingly, reached her. “I was a nobody,” she said. “I had no position or stature.” — location: [1425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1425) ^ref-47935

---
She opened it and marked everything she found wrong—which was, basically, everything—and sent it back to her boss. “I was kind of a typical CDC person. Everything was no, no, no. Everything had to be right. And it had to be so right that it was not wrong.” — location: [1427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1427) ^ref-52031

Old Dave Mindset

---
she was prepared to remain unfriendly. She had an unflattering preconception of “guy from the White House.” Blue suit. Self-important. Stuck-up. Three hours later, she’d more or less agreed to write chapter 9 for Carter Mecher. “I just liked him instantly,” she recalled. “He wasn’t some slick White House dude. He was like a guy in a t-shirt with motor oil under his fingernails. He wasn’t a bastard.” — location: [1433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1433) ^ref-24975

---
Carter also had real humility about him. “He said, ‘I don’t know about these things, and I think you do, and I need your help.’ ” I’d been working for a long time with a lot of people for whom I’m nothing but chopped liver. So I said, He’s trying to do good things. I’m going to help him.” — location: [1439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1439) ^ref-16726

---
“It blew my mind,” she said. “The specific thing that blew my mind was using multiple semi-effective strategies together. There was no silver bullet. Right then I say, ‘This is important. This has legs. It’s not my job. I don’t give a shit. I’m working on this.’ ” — location: [1455](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1455) ^ref-27772

This is your super power

They believed none of these so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions would contribute anything but economic loss. “The argument was that we had no real-world data,” said Richard. “That this was all just models.” The subtext of every criticism was: we’re experts and you are not. After the meeting, Lisa gave Richard a nickname: Piñata. — location: [1468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1468) ^ref-5670

---
“I had become overidentified with the arguments,” he said, “and it was too easy to attack me as the crazy guy with the crazy arguments.” Carter, on the other hand, had somehow remained uncontroversial. He’d been in the White House for six months, edited the entire plan and written big chunks of it, and helped dream up a strategy for disease control that seemed to piss off every agency in the federal government. But he had this curious ability to remain invisible. — location: [1472](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1472) ^ref-22618

“People would object to what he’d write,” he said, “but he’d already have thought it through and anticipated the objections. He doesn’t dismiss your issues. He accepts that this is somebody else’s reality.” — location: [1476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1476) ^ref-18403

Pre anticipate your opponents arguments and defang them

The next day he sent, not just to Rajeev but also to Richard and Lisa, a single-spaced, thirteen-page memo, “Analysis of Philadelphia Outbreak 1918.” He’d gone back over some of Barry’s original sources—academic papers, old newspaper articles, and so on—to tease out at what point various local leaders had imposed restrictions on social life. — location: [1493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1493) ^ref-30146

When you get the motivation to do a thing, realize what a gift it is and find a way to clear your schedule to get it done

Why had it taken nearly a century to see a simple truth about the single most deadly pandemic in human history? Only after three amateur historians studied the various interventions, and the various death tolls in individual American cities, did the importance of timing became obvious. Carter wondered why this had been so hard to see. A big part of the answer, he decided, was in the nature of pandemics. They were exponential processes. — location: [1535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1535) ^ref-29548

American society now leaned on schools to care for children in a way that would have bewildered Americans of an earlier age, as that other institution, the family, was failing at the job. “The sub-rosa conversation was that families weren’t safe places for children,” — location: [1550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1550) ^ref-43451

---
He did that kind of thing over and over: take some problem others thought insurmountably huge and shrink it until it seemed manageable. And yet he had no effect on people’s deep feeling that it wasn’t worth the cost of closing schools, or intervening in American social life in any other way, to slow a pandemic. — location: [1561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1561) ^ref-53037

---
There’d come a moment when he and Richard had both almost given up. Afterward they’d decided that, rather than try to change people’s minds, they ought to try changing people’s hearts. Or, rather, that the way to change minds was by first changing hearts. Carter ceased his appeals to reason and began to appeal to emotion—which is to say that he stopped making an argument and began to tell a story. His story, at its core, was about the hole left when someone dies, especially when the death is preventable, and the someone is a child. — location: [1563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1563) ^ref-22401

The Mexicans, interestingly, had taken the new pandemic strategy of the United States and run with it. They’d closed schools, and socially distanced the population in other ways that, studies would later show, shut down disease transmission. The CDC, by contrast, sent the message that each American school should make its own decision, — location: [1755](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1755) ^ref-29894

---
A few schools closed, but the vast majority did not. The local public-health officials with the power to close the schools had no political cover to do what needed doing. In that moment it was clear to Richard and Carter that there’d be no cohesive national strategy. — location: [1758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1758) ^ref-18457

Early on, they’d been discussing the pandemic plan, and he had shared with her his thoughts about maps. They were also his thoughts about plans, as a plan is a kind of map: a map of what you plan to do. He told her a story about some troops who’d gotten lost in the Alps. “They’re in a blizzard,” said Carter. “A guy finds a map in his backpack. The map leads them to safety.” What was cool about the story, Carter thought, was that once the soldiers were safe and able to study the map more closely, they saw that it was a map not of the Alps but of the Pyrenees. “A map has value when you are lost,” he said. “It gives you a starting point.” — location: [1836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=1836) ^ref-5116

weird black market would arise in the stuff you needed to wake the Panther up: Joe had a photo of a guy selling Panther equipment out of the back of his car. “Here is the frightening aspect of the global supply chain,” said Joe. “When there is a surge in demand, inventory goes to zero. Just-in-time manufacturing. Great concept! Horrible in a pandemic.” — location: [3466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3466) ^ref-54369

---
With Hawgood’s blessing, Joe and his team ransacked the university’s labs for chemicals and liquid handling robots, and testing machines that were far less idiot-proof but capable of detecting COVID-19. They grabbed spare parts and built machines themselves. On a rainy evening in mid-March Joe could be found alone on the streets of San Francisco wheeling some cart bearing a purloined machine. These machines also needed special chemicals to analyze samples, and the market for these chemicals had tightened, but, as with the machines themselves, the market for them was more resilient in a crisis. — location: [3473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3473) ^ref-35644

---
Here Joe learned, or perhaps relearned, another lesson about the private sector. As a Stanford graduate student, he had seen previously open and collaborative colleagues clam up the moment some venture capitalist threw money at them. “One day you come to work and their office shades would be down,” he said. Over and over again he saw the wild inefficiency of the private sector as a creator of knowledge. Far more often than not, some promising avenue of research would die as a failed company. He hated that; he hated the way financial ambition interfered with science and progress. As a pathogen threatened to overrun the United States and shut down its economy, he detected an odor he distinctly did not like coming off the private sector. One company was the biggest supplier of an enzyme they needed to run tests. “We called and told them what we were doing and that we wanted to buy a million dollars’ worth of the stuff,” said Joe. “When you buy that quantity you always get a discount. But they said nope, you’re paying full price.” He was so pissed off that he looked around and found a smaller company, New England Biolabs, that sold the same enzyme. “Completely different spirit,” said Joe. “They said, ‘This is amazing! Forty percent discount right now!’ That’s how companies should behave.” It went that way with much of what they needed to buy: some companies sought to exploit the moment; others sought to help. “We quickly figured out that some companies actually have a moral compass and some of them don’t,” said Joe. On March 18, just eight days after the idea was born, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub’s new COVID lab opened for business. It had taken Joe’s new team two days less to build an entire lab than it was then taking Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp to process a single test. The new lab’s two hundred or so overqualified young research scientists were able to process 2,666 tests a day, as accurately as any lab in the country. (They’d demonstrated their accuracy by taking samples that had already been processed in a smaller but highly accurate lab at UCSF and retesting them.) They’d be able to return results to people within a day; in a pinch, they could get you an answer in three hours. And—here was the kicker—they worked for free. There was no bill. You just handed over your test tubes with the nasal swab inside and the Biohub told you who had COVID-19 and who did not. Joe assumed, not unreasonably, that his new team of volunteers would soon be overrun by hordes of customers delighted by the freebie. The previous week, the entire state of California had received fewer than two thousand COVID-19 test results. Test tubes holding nasal swabs from more than 55,000 Californians were lying around in labs waiting to be evaluated. By redirecting 2,666 a day from the big corporate labs, the state of California could save itself $426,560 every day and get results back in time to make a difference. But they were not overrun by customers. The first few weeks,… — location: [3477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3477) ^ref-18153

Many local health offices were so understaffed and underequipped that they had trouble using the test kits. Most were unable to receive the results electronically; they needed the results faxed to them. Some had fax machines so old that they couldn’t receive more than six pages at a time. A few didn’t even have functioning fax machines, and so the Biohub got into the business of buying and delivering fax machines along with test kits. — location: [3588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3588) ^ref-30822

What he saw in the local U.S. public-health offices remined him of public services in Poland, but before the collapse of communism. “Poland now is not like this,” said David, after seeing the inside of a U.S. public-health office. “Poland now is more functional. Eastern Europeans are tough and kind of not shocked by a failed state. But these are the symptoms of a failed state.” — location: [3607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3607) ^ref-46666

The chart was a simplified snapshot of the genetic relationships of all the virus found in the four-square-block area of San Francisco in late April 2020. You had to stare at it a bit to see the implications, and even then you sort of needed Joe’s help. But look hard enough and you’d see, from the virus’s point of view, a terrifying new weapon. “In all of history we’ve never had a really clear picture of the spread of a virus,” said Joe. “That just changed.” — location: [3729](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3729) ^ref-55765

“This same resident who likely infected the household may have also infected two workers who don’t even live in the Mission,” said Joe, pointing to another household of workers, one step to the right of those residents. “It’s possible there is one degree of separation between them—that he gave it to someone who gave it to them. But no more than that.” — location: [3740](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3740) ^ref-3828

“It’s amazing that all these stories fall into place,” said Joe, as he scrolled through that first chart they’d created.

Is there ever been a more Mark Hansen validating line in history

Around the same time as the Mission study, up in Humboldt County a meth dealer had tested positive for COVID-19. The public-health nurses had gotten to him soon after he’d been infected, and he agreed to isolate himself. The nurses suspected he was still sneaking out at night, and suspected it even more when a friend of his became infected. That friend lived with his son and daughter-in-law, who worked at Alder Bay Assisted Living, in Eureka. The daughter-in-law had no symptoms, but within a week more than a dozen Alder Bay staff members and residents had been infected. Four died. The public-health nurses could not see the chain of events. Then they received the genome sequencing from the Biohub, and it showed that everyone in Alder Bay had been infected by the daughter-in-law, and that her virus had come from her father-in-law, and that his virus had come from the meth dealer. “It’s like the DNA evidence in a crime,” said a Humboldt County public-health nurse named Erica Dykehouse. “When we got it we said, ‘We’re not crazy! We’re not crazy!!!!’ ” — location: [3759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3759) ^ref-54761

Why do we keep building technologies that get turned into panopticons?

In an age not all that distant from our own, the fish-packing plant, which believed it had taken the measures necessary to keep its workers safe, would have been forced to close. It would have had to assume that one of the workers infected the other on the job. But the Biohub sequenced the viruses from the two infected workers and discovered that they were genetically very far apart. The workers had contracted the virus independently, outside of work. The fish-packing plant could stay open, and all its workers could keep their jobs. — location: [3772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3772) ^ref-33019

Why do you keep building technologies that simply get used to empower the holders of capital to do what they want

in February 2021, the number of genomes being sequenced in the United States was trivial—less than a third of 1 percent of the virus in people who tested positive. (The UK was by then sequencing 10 percent of its positives; Denmark had set a goal of sequencing all of them.) The United States was sequencing fewer of its genomes than any other industrialized country, and the only reason it was sequencing as many as it was is that a bunch of nonprofits had stepped in to do it, haphazardly, for free. — location: [3783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3783) ^ref-39891

The afternoon of the scheduled meeting, he sat at his desk staring at the Zoom screen. Priscilla was in another box. A few other Biohub people were there, too. There was only one box with a state official in it: Charity Dean was her name. But her box was dark. After several awkward minutes, when it became clear that Ghaly wasn’t going to show up, she finally turned on her camera and unmuted herself. — location: [3799](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3799) ^ref-57286

The American institutions built to manage risk and respond to a virus had been engaged in a weird simulation of crisis response that did not involve actually trying to stop the virus. “The greatest trick the CDC ever pulled was convincing the world containment wasn’t possible,” she said. “Our dignity was lost in not even trying to contain it.” — location: [3857](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3857) ^ref-60956

She wondered if perhaps they had undergone a process similar to her own—a descent, which ended with them devoting lots of energy to appearing to know what to do when they did not. “In the beginning it’s filling in gaps,” said Charity. “You let the falsehood continue until slowly the falsehood takes over. By the time you’re done, you are no longer just filling blank spots. You have this burden of maintaining optics. It’s all optics.” — location: [3860](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=3860) ^ref-20659

Managing for optics is its own form of technical debt.

Her role, it seemed, was to do stuff the state’s chief health officer was meant to do, while not being seen doing it, as that might raise questions about why the chief health officer wasn’t.

Sencer knew that a mass vaccination program would be costly and controversial: you didn’t stick needles into two hundred seventeen million arms without something going wrong. He also knew that there was no way to eliminate the unpleasantness of the decision: the situation was inherently uncertain. As for the matter of why he did not ask for a vote, recalled Bill Foege, “He said, ‘This is going to be political, and if it goes wrong I’m going to need to take the blame.’ ” Holding a vote would have implicated others in the decision and damaged their reputations along with his own.

The short book was very well done. Calling it a “report” made it sound objective and almost scientific when it was really just journalism. From their interviews the authors wove a compelling narrative and delivered it in a tone of lordly omniscience. The story had one clear villain, David Sencer. The villain had one accomplice, Dr. Theodore Cooper, but his role was less central, like a getaway driver’s. Sencer for his part came off as at best sneaky and at worst wildly manipulative: Sencer was not President. Yet as he did his work this may have been a distinction without a difference. For he evidently thought it was his task to make his constitutional superiors do right no matter what they thought (and so he did). He also made them do it with but little time to think.

But if Joe Califano felt any need to justify how he’d fired Sencer—the first time a CDC director had been dismissed by a political superior—the book slaked it. His immediate reaction to what had been written as a private document was to make it public. “We intended it just for Califano,” recalled Harvey Fineberg. “After taking one look at it, he said, ‘I have to publish this.’ ” The book’s publication amplified David Sencer’s humiliation and put anyone in public health who might stick out his neck to make a decision on notice.

When she said she wanted to build a tool “to save the country,” people just smiled and thought she was goofy in the head. But when she said things like “I’m going to create a data-based tool for disease prevention that companies can use to secure their supply chains,” serious business types nodded. “Five smart people have replied with confusion when I said the company was to save the world and protect our country,” said Charity, after her first attempts to explain her vague idea. “Then when I said, ‘We’re going to do private government operations, like Blackwater,’ their eyes lit up and they said, ‘Oh wow, you could take over the world.’ ” She’d entered the private sector with the bizarre ambition to use it to create an institution that might be used by the public sector. — location: [4212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08V91YY8R&location=4212) ^ref-57418
