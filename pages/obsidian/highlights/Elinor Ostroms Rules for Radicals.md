## Highlights
core goal of public policy should be to facilitate the development of institutions that bring out the best in humans. (Ostrom and Ostrom 2014: 197) — location: [55](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=55) ^ref-52914

The biologist Garrett Hardin wrote ‘The Tragedy of the Commons’ in 1968, arguing that collective property was inevitably doomed to failure, because it would be abused by users (Hardin 1968). — location: [67](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=67) ^ref-26842

How is it only that recent‽

Her early years, shaped by divorce, the depression and the Second World War, seem to have instilled a frugality in her that is perhaps unusual for economists and might have contributed to her later passion for ecological living. She helped in the garden and with canning fruit produced by her mother. She felt that part of the solution to environmental problems would come with us consuming less and downsizing. — location: [83](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=83) ^ref-61224

---
Sadly, she was prevented from taking economics because it was claimed she had not studied enough mathematics at high school. In turn, at school when she had asked to study further mathematics this had been refused because she was a woman! Her school advisor, she claimed, had asked what use trigonometry would be when she was ‘barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen’ (Cronin 2012: 90). — location: [102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=102) ^ref-54613

Ugggjhhh

If too many users took too much water out of West Basin, it would lower the water level and tend to suck in salt water from the Pacific. Salinization made the water unusable and threatened the whole Basin. Elinor discovered that despite huge difficulties the different users were able to cooperate, ration their extraction of water and maintain the system. They prevented a tragedy of the commons from occurring. — location: [145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=145) ^ref-45461

She developed a research project into policing, arguing that input from local communities led to better policing. — location: [151](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=151) ^ref-25693

How did i nkt knoww that she was paart of the ideologicall basis for community policing!?

but she was very clear that her discipline was political economy not economics. She saw economics as powerfully shaped by institutions, so in turn saw herself specifically as institutionalist. Institutions are sets of rules created by human beings; economists sometimes forget that economic activity does not just happen, but is shaped by political institutions too. — location: [157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=157) ^ref-63788

---
This emphasis on institutions provides a sophisticated way of viewing economic activity and it is useful for understanding political and social change. She felt that democratic control made for effective problem solving as well as being desirable in its own right, so political institutions needed participation rather than centralised top-down management. — location: [160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=160) ^ref-34133

---
For hundreds of years, perhaps for thousands, collectively-owned resources have been stolen from communities with the simple justification that the commons was inevitably ‘tragic’. Left to collective ownership, it is often claimed, individuals would abuse the system and wreck the commons. Either privatisation or strong state control was needed to prevent catastrophe, both alternatives demanded the destruction of the commons and removal of the commoners. — location: [185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=185) ^ref-50304

Booooo

---
She found that commons could be made to work and were not automatically doomed because of an intrinsic flaw in human nature. Her careful research is a powerful weapon of self-defence for those who wish to protect a commons under threat. — location: [189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=189) ^ref-4591

---
Equally radical and useful is her notion that economics and politics, potentially, move beyond the market and the state. — location: [191](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=191) ^ref-30602

---
On the left we might pay lip service to Marx’s notion of the ‘withering away of the state’ but generally we see either the state or the market. We usually forget that there is more to economics than money or government decisions. — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=193) ^ref-5455

---
The notion that there is something other than the market or the state is apparently unthinkable and is generally unthought of on both the left and the right. Ostrom, in contrast, explicitly saw economics as something that, while including states and markets, could go beyond them. She rather boldly entitled her Nobel lecture ‘Beyond Markets and States: Polycentric Governance of Complex Economic Systems’ (Ostrom 2010a). — location: [199](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=199) ^ref-27633

Her academic work was based on what she termed co-production, knowledge and theory was constructed with the active participation of the community. She had no time for the kind of academic work that was removed from the population that it sought to study. Her perspective was based not on telling but listening, dethroning academic expertise and asking academics to take note of the people. She believed teamwork was generally more effective than individual work in creating knowledge. She stressed that while she had authored Governing the Commons and won an economics prize for doing so, she was part of a larger network. Many of her books and articles were co-authored. She also felt that in researching the commons and allied issues both social and natural science were needed; her interdisciplinary enthusiasm was another reason why she valued team work. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=203) ^ref-25223

---
Many of Ostrom’s key interests reflect those of an ecosocialist left. If, like me, you are a left-wing member of a Green Party, you will find many of your concerns shared within her work. She focused on ecological sustainability and showed a lifelong commitment to promoting equality. She was an advocate of diversity, celebrating the fact that academic life was beginning to open up to diverse ethnicities and that the status of women in university life was improving. Elinor Ostrom can be seen as moving beyond Eurocentrism, recognising the insights of indigenous people within her work. — location: [210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=210) ^ref-64197

---
She was also radical in that she believed that democracy was key to solving ecological problems and by democracy she meant not just traditional liberal democracy but popular involvement through direct participation, not top-down institutions. — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=214) ^ref-13178

---
She and her husband Vincent spent a lifetime arguing that the more that people were involved in constructing the rules of governance, the better the rules would work. Her inspiration was that of the New England township meeting, where the community made decisions collectively and directly. — location: [216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=216) ^ref-58706

---
For both Vincent and Elinor, individuals make politics rather than politics being made by just some individuals in a select, supposedly representative elite. They argued that politics runs through society and expands beyond formal structures such as parliaments. The Ostroms also felt that, to the extent that formal politics via political parties, Senates, councils was relevant, it worked best where democracy was deep and participation strong. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=229) ^ref-50793

---
She might be seen as perhaps a conservative thinker and certainly a cautious one if viewed from a particular perspective but as a radical if viewed from another. It’s a strange kind of conservatism that sees beyond private property, promotes cooperation and looks to economics that is neither state nor market based. — location: [232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=232) ^ref-14371

---
While Aligică and other commentators observe that such pragmatism doesn’t disguise some core underlying assumptions about both research and politics, problem solving rather than fixed principle was key to her and Vincent’s work. Elinor, for example, wasn’t specifically concerned with advancing an ideology that was either pro or anti the state, or for or against the market; while her radical democratic ideals are obvious, she started with a question rather than a policy or political demand. The question was how, given the existence of common pool resources, these resources could be conserved. She doggedly addressed this practical problem using the most advanced techniques she could find from social science, ranging from historical case studies to game theory models to experiments. — location: [264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=264) ^ref-61819

---
One rule that radicals can take from Ostrom is that we should reject slogans and broad principles but instead focus on interventions. We want an ecological society, so rather than simply proclaiming this we need to ask what this means in practice. In dealing with ecological problems she focused most specifically on natural resource commons and in doing so explicitly used perspectives from both social and natural sciences. — location: [271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=271) ^ref-41864

---
her work, like Alinsky’s, points to a practical politics that can focus our efforts to change society for the better. — location: [311](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=311) ^ref-63430

---
Elinor argued that slogans and demands were never enough, we have to take a specific and pragmatic approach to achieve a better society. — location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=312) ^ref-24291

---
Ostrom can be seen as a political ecologist, concerned with how politics influences our ability to deal with environmental problems. As such her work can contribute to developing a more sophisticated form of green politics. To my knowledge, the links between her analysis and green politics have been largely unexplored. She advocated greater equality, social justice, peace-making and grassroots democracy which, along with ecological sustainability, are core features of green politics. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=322) ^ref-16160

---
Ostrom showed that parts of the economy vital to human prosperity and survival, such as commons, are often invisible to economists. — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=343) ^ref-36671

---
she notes that metaphors, such as the model of the tragedy of the commons, can influence economic policymaking and we should be more conscious of the risks inherent in the construction of misleadingly simplistic narratives. — location: [344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=344) ^ref-6237

---
The tragedy of the commons was likely to occur if individuals failed to cooperate and the necessary cooperation was only possible if individuals trusted each other. Trust and cooperation are also vital to the creation of an alternative to neoliberalism, as they are essential in creating a more democratic and equal economy. — location: [352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=352) ^ref-2225

---
She was fascinated by research methodology because she was aware that different types of methodology could produce different understandings of social reality. The methodology of economists which was based on often simplistic formal models and statistical data led to the notion of the ‘tragedy of the commons’. Misleading methodology led to flawed conclusions and, in turn, damaging policies such as the privatisation or nationalisation of the commons. She perceived much academic work as individualist, narrow and elitist. She promoted a radical take on education based on participation. This fed back into her work on ecological economics and democracy. She believed that education should be participatory and that political education should focus on promoting self-organisation. — location: [359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=359) ^ref-7016

A thing is not the same as the legal form of ownership it takes. She also noted that legal notions of ownership were more diverse than is often assumed. Thus, common pool property may not be the same as a common pool resource. — location: [473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0771LYTPV&location=473) ^ref-59242
