## Highlights
trouble with time management; a tendency to be impulsive; seeks out high stimulation; tends to be impatient; tends to be stubborn; problems with organization, planning, and prioritizing; a tendency to self medicate with alcohol or drugs; mood instability; and the tendency to worry needlessly. — location: [197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=197) ^ref-18465

---
correlate of ADHD called sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT). Individuals with SCT are described as exhibiting reduced activity, a tendency to daydream, confusion, and lethargy. — location: [282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=282) ^ref-47500

the predominately inattentive type, 2) the predominately hyperactive-impulsive type, or 3) the combined type — location: [344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=344) ^ref-6742

---
The combined type of ADHD meant that criteria had been met for not only inattention, but also for the hyperactive and impulsive cluster of symptoms. — location: [345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=345) ^ref-64258

---
while ADHD often persists from childhood into adulthood, its presentation usually becomes more subtle as the individual ages. Frequently, there are fewer overt symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity, but challenges with restlessness, inattention, and disorganization remain (Kooij et al., 2010). — location: [500](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=500) ^ref-6620

---
the gender disparity in adult ADHD diagnosis may be far less, with a more even ratio of males and females exhibiting enduring symptoms of the disorder (Babinski et al., 2011). — location: [511](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=511) ^ref-1145

ADHD is frequently comorbid with a number of other psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder, anxiety, learning disorders, and depression — location: [526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=526) ^ref-31294

---
structural neuroimaging (e.g., MRI and CT scans) and functional neuroimaging (e.g., PET scans and fMRI) have implicated reduced physical size and decreased metabolism in several regions of the brain that are associated with some of the common cognitive deficits of ADHD, such as working memory, divided attention, and executive functioning. These include the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and certain subcortical structures such as the globus pallidus and putamen (Arnsten, 2009; Rösler et al., 2010; Sato et al., 2012). The findings suggest a possible pathway by which some of the noted deficits and challenges of ADHD might occur at a physiological level. Again, they are linked with these deficits but are not necessarily the cause of these problems, as they may be part of a wider circuit that is aberrant due to ADHD, or perhaps indirectly impacted by another brain structure that is functioning sub-optimally in the brains of individuals with ADHD — location: [551](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=551) ^ref-31066

---
These authors noted that the literature suggests that adults with ADHD tend to exhibit challenges with attention, organization, planning, task completion, and time management. — location: [577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=577) ^ref-27366

relational and other problems persist into adulthood for those with ADHD. — location: [579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=579) ^ref-4524

---
Not initiating or completing tasks, persistent distractibility, and suboptimal time management skills are all common experiences for adults with ADHD. As Manos (2010) tersely characterizes this phenomenon, “the broken agreement is a hallmark of dysfunction in adults with ADHD” (p. 515). — location: [581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=581) ^ref-1117

Because of the highly inattentive and disorganized aspects of adult ADHD, the individual’s roles and responsibilities in family, work, and intimate relationship situations are typically quite degraded. In particular, relationships, marriages, and parenting may be challenging for adults with ADHD (Rösler et al., 2010; Waite & Ramsay, 2007). — location: [583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=583) ^ref-30625

and more frequent changes in jobs than individuals who do not have ADHD. — location: [590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=590) ^ref-5476

---
inattentive symptoms of ADHD were associated with nicotine use (cigarettes) after controlling for conduct disorder symptoms, but that ADHD symptoms were not associated with elevated use of alcohol or other drugs for this group. — location: [603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=603) ^ref-34708

---
frequent conditions co-occurring with ADHD include mood and anxiety disorders, other neurodevelopmental disorders, some personality disorders, and impulse related challenges. — location: [610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=610) ^ref-52887

---
In fact, 70 to 75 percent of adults with ADHD may qualify for a comorbid diagnosis (Ramsay & Rostain, 2007). Dowson (2008) found many frequent comorbid conditions in adults with ADHD involving mood disorders, substance use, and certain personality disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder). — location: [613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=613) ^ref-42370

---
while others have noted clinically that certain drugs (e.g., marijuana) sometimes help some individuals with ADHD to better sustain focus (Farone et al., 2007). — location: [639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=639) ^ref-817

---
Whether due to environmental factors, depleted levels of synaptic dopamine, or reduced functioning in the prefrontal cortex, adults with ADHD often engage in impulsive behavior, such as risky driving and use of substances (Weisler & Goodman, 2008). — location: [640](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=640) ^ref-37337

---
They looked at the association between ADHD symptoms and internet addiction. The researchers found that screened symptoms of ADHD (rather than formal diagnoses by established clinical criteria) were associated with internet addiction behaviors. In particular, the attentional aspects of ADHD were more linked with the internet activities, and more prevalent among females than males (Yen et al., 2009). — location: [643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=643) ^ref-48480

couples therapy and coaching skills for partnerships that have been negatively impacted when one or both partners have adult ADHD. — location: [654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=654) ^ref-56527

---
Individual therapy, often using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or behavioral methods, is also frequently employed with adults who are struggling with the effects of ADHD. One prototypical example is a manualized individual CBT approach for adults developed by Safren, Perlman, Sprich, and Otto (2005). — location: [657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=657) ^ref-47677

---
medication for ADHD does not eradicate all symptoms of the disorder, and so the combination of medication with therapy or coaching is considered a more optimal and comprehensive treatment strategy. — location: [664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=664) ^ref-47798

---
Medication alone, however, may be insufficient to treat the symptoms of ADHD in up to 50 percent of adults with the disorder (Ramsay & Rostain, 2007). In particular, concerns involving organization, time management, and interpersonal challenges may be less effectively mitigated with medication. — location: [675](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=675) ^ref-42212

---
Family and couples’ therapy may be particularly beneficial to help with task sharing, daily planning, and everyday functioning. In addition to traditional CBT methods, individuals directly and indirectly impacted by ADHD may benefit from training in problem-solving and coping skills, as these aspects of the disorder tend to be less successfully extinguished by medication alone (Weisler & Goodman, 2008). — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=697) ^ref-9351

---
Finally, another group of researchers found the self-reported mindfulness was lower in adults with ADHD than in those without the disorder, suggesting that mindfulness training might be beneficial for individuals with ADHD (Smalley et al., 2009). — location: [704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=704) ^ref-24463

They frequently walk into a therapist’s office believing that poor communication skills, anger, their partner’s frustration, depression, or anxiety is the problem that needs addressing in therapy. — location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=819) ^ref-25171

therapists and couples who address those surface issues without attending to the underlying ADHD will significantly sub-optimize counseling. — location: [821](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=821) ^ref-20967

---
As adults with ADHD age, their likelihood of divorce rises to almost double that of non-ADHD adults (Murphy & Barkley, 1996). Studies done with younger and older patients yielded information that divorce rates are higher among older couples affected by ADHD because repetitive, untreated ADHD symptoms damage relationships over time. — location: [825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=825) ^ref-25989

Research suggests the rate of clinically diagnosable marital dysfunction for adults with ADHD is about 58%, or double that of the non-ADHD couples — location: [827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=827) ^ref-60851

---
partners  of adults with ADHD—and sometimes even their therapists—frequently misinterpret ADHD symptoms when they are unaware of the disorder. The misinterpretation of ADHD symptoms causes significant and unnecessary distress in the relationship, and it may be a reason why the divorce rate for these couples is so high. — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=840) ^ref-47867

Symptom: Distraction—inability to sustain attention in the face of distracting external stimuli, particularly for things of little interest to him/her. Associated Characteristic Behavior: The patient is able to sustain his/her focus on things that interest him/her, but not on things of lesser inherent interest or immediacy. Partner’s Misinterpretation: “My partner is able to happily stay focused on the computer or hobby all day, but can’t pay attention to me or our mutual responsibilities for very long. I must not be important to my partner.” Partner’s Common Behavioral Response: Feelings of anger and depression in the non-ADHD partner may lead to an increase in aggressive or intrusive behavior or, conversely, to disengagement and loss of hope. — location: [855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=855) ^ref-39225

---
Symptom: Poor inhibition or poor working memory. Associated Characteristic Behavior: The patient often interrupts his/her partner while the partner is speaking because the patient wishes to avoid forgetting the thought that he/she wishes to share. Partner’s Misinterpretation: “My partner is rude to me and doesn’t respect me or what I have to say.” Partner’s Common Behavioral Response: Interpretation of being ignored leads to anger and attempts to “teach” the partner with ADHD better manners, or engaging in fewer conversations with the partner with ADHD. — location: [863](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=863) ^ref-47541

---
Symptom: Difficulty organizing and completing tasks. Associated Characteristic Behavior: The patient promises to do something, such as a household chore, but then often does not follow through on it. Partner’s Misinterpretation: “My partner is not reliable or trustworthy.” Partner’s Common Behavioral Response: The non-ADHD partner assumes the bulk of the family responsibilities, resulting in feelings of being overwhelmed and resentful. As this pattern continues, many non-ADHD partners assume a “parental” or controlling role in an effort to keep their household under control. — location: [870](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=870) ^ref-12360

undiagnosed ADHD may explain their past interactions, it generally does not justify the continuation of those actions into the future. — location: [893](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=893) ^ref-6066

---
An important role that the therapist can play at this time is to help the couple, and particularly the partner with ADHD, differentiate between core characteristics of who they are, and behavioral patterns that have become habits over the years, but which do not add to that person’s life in a constructive way. — location: [900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=900) ^ref-12310

---
is sometimes as much of a struggle for the non-ADHD partner to change as it is for the ADHD partner to solidify their treatment plan. By the time they seek a marriage counselor, non-ADHD partners may have built up years of resentment, anger, frustration, hurt, and hopelessness. — location: [912](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=912) ^ref-63170

---
the “consistent inconsistency” of their ADHD partners has taught them that their partners simply cannot be trusted to do what they have promised to do, or to pay attention to them as assured that they would. This breach of trust cuts at the heart of the relationship. — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=914) ^ref-27730

---
The unidentified or under-treated ADHD symptoms may initiate the cycle of dysfunction, and negative responses to the symptoms extend and deepen a negative feedback loop in the relationship. — location: [945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H121KS6&location=945) ^ref-40422
