# Analysis
## Threats
- Every other subscription attention business online (see netflix competing against sleep). We serve a small market, so we have a higher cost per user, which we pass on in subscription costs. To aggregate our geographic market we need to deliver more value (actually publish information people need and want so badly they prefer it in our bundle). But that means competing against not only the NYT, but particularly TV streaming services. We're at a structural disadvantage as long as we have a high cost product that isn't being read by philadelphians.
- The form factor for information consumption is shifting and we need to evolve our product offering to account for that. 

## Weaknesses
- Lack of meaningful operational alignment across the organization. Everyone gets it in theory, yet few departments or projects find meaningful ways to make it ubiquitous to their operations.
- Bus Factors everywhere. From a 20 year period of "Creating Efficiencies" we're left with an organization that's 
- People don't have frameworks that their efforts contribute to. Good ideas abound, but where and how the value of those ideas could be realized 
- Newsroom wants to evolve the product so that we can reach more disconnected communities more meaningfully, not just raw people. They understand that requires thinking longer term and often evolving the business model.
