# Notes
- ## Inquirer Engineering Systems Overview with [[Toan Dang]]
  date:: [[2021-12-16]]
	- ![Another System Diagram - Today (1).pdf](../../assets/Another_System_Diagram_-_Today_(1)_1653753884366_0.pdf)
	- SYSTEMS:
		- WebSked = scheduling for newsroom. Assigning stories alongside story budget
			- who's reporter, who's photographer
			- Used for pitching for front page or sections (both for site and physical paper)
				- some exceptions (e.g. sports in print paper) but mostly used for print and digital
		- Naviga: print side
			- Naviga DSI - distribution circulation and subscription system.
				- legacy DB. Still used to export daily print distribution list
		- Some things from these systems moved to data warehouse
			- principally GA data & firebase
			- Capture BlueConic
			- Martech applications captured mostly through FE GA Events
			- Nothing really captured on the Advertising side, but do capture some of our own FB Ad Data, Google Ads, raw commenting data via Forua, Auth0, some SF, Salesforce, Eventbrite
		- Site Data Collection ( #Instrumentation )
			- [[Google Analytics]]
			- [[Chartbeat]]
			- [[Mather]] - Major #vendor
				- Economics consultant for pricing
				- Marketing team uses them as data science capability
				- Lot of overlap with what we're collecting on the listener side
					- we have to support it
					- Starting to explore Google Ad Tag Manager Serverside
						- one tag collects data on your site, then can reshape it for Mather
				- provide their own churn model
				- DONE #task Meet [[Mather]] Econometrics #vendor 🔼
			- Comscore
				- Necessary evil
				- Just upgraded to a higer quality peer feedback data
			- Optimize: AB Testing tool
				- tightly integrated with GA
				- Been too filled with friction to do good experiment design for Product / Engineering teams
				- Data needs in conflict with eng/product usability / experiment design needs
			- OneTrust - CCPA compliance (GeoIPed to California)
				- We get a lot of CCPA requests, which we can't do
				- Nobody told Mark CCPA compliance and audits were his job
				- **we have never resourced #governance nor compliance here and have huge issues around governance and compliance as a result**
			- BlueConic: Customer Data Platform
				- "Resolve user identity" - Tracks user behavior in a customer focused model.
					- Collects on frontend AND backend
				- Should be able to drive customer behavior
					- "give me users who've read sports articles in the last 30 days" and can export that to Marketing Cloud
				- Super JS based; doesn't work well with AMP
				- Implemented in an ad-hoc way, so not piped in with unified definitions or source-true definitions
			- Wunderkind (formerly BounceX) - marketing integration. Used for driving newsletter signup.
				- Could all be done in BlueConic.
			- Brown Institute has a Snowplow Analytics (self-hosted analytics).
				- Potential recommendation engine tool. Talk to [[Todd Gillespe]]. Related to Feeds
			- Ad Tracking: We haven't been involved in their work
				- Just in the beginning stages of partnering with them.
					- Some opportunities to support with data warehouse
						- Ads Group would be a good customer group for [[Data Platform]] / [[Data Warehouse]]. Think of them as a key
				- Sources:
					- Google Ad Manager:
						- tools suck, we created ourselves and are no longer paying some consultants.
						- We want to warehouse and optimize our work for them.
					- LiveIntent (new): Newsletters & news alerts
		- Commenting:
			- Viafoura - Commenting platform
				- disabled year and a half ago except for sports
				- Track FE events (comments) and have raw commenting data of individual users; so could use in segmentation
					- We are ingesting the data from Viafoura
						- batch nightly
						- [x] #task Let Becky know we have the Viafoura commenting data available ✅ 2022-01-12
		- Marketing:
			- [[Auth0]] : Signin: email + social sign in
				- Definition of a unique person.
					- also includes their social sign on.
					- Big use for reporting; lets us join GA data to email data
				- HIGH COST VENDOR. Currently 100k/yr. [[Toan Dang]] Want to replace in 2025.
					- [ ] #task Plan for stable person ID and deprecation of Auth0 ⏫
			- [[Piano]] - Metering
				- overlap with piano, [[blueconic]], wunderkind, [[Mather]]
			- Salesforce Service portal: Definition of a unique person
				- Manage subscriptions, support faq
	- The Inquirer's data #needs (at a high level): Split users into cohorts, deliver them the relevant experiences, and have access to the data of those users.
		- Challenges:
			- Lots of web data collection
				- Many trackers on our site for lots of vendors
					- we don't control a lot of them
					- would want to reshape them and send parallel tags
						- Google serverside ad tag manager
				- Had been part of First Party Data efforts initially
					- lots of the folks involved have left (adsales lead, )
			- Integration of Experimentation and data. Our tool sucks for usability so it doesn't get used.
			- Lots of privacy requests, Need to delete from transactional data systems, but can't
			- Lots of data, going to lots of places, without much thought, leading to lots of risk of governance
				- [[Informatica]] :
					- Integration between print publication ([[DSI]]) and Salesforce is done by Informatica
					- Pulls data from Salesforce -> BQ
					- Informatica will continue to be used to sync DSI -> Salesforce. DSI will continue to be operational.
					- a few things in informatica to ship data to Mather.
- Action Items:
	- DONE meet with mather to learn about them
	- LATER Eventual need for a data collection & data flow diagram
