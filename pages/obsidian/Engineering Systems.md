	  SYSTEMS:
	- WebSked = scheduling for newsroom. Assigning stories alongside story budget
		- who's reporter, who's photographer
		- Used for pitching for front page or sections (both for site and physical paper)
			- some exceptions (e.g. sports in print paper) but mostly used for print and digital
	- Naviga: print side
		- Naviga DSI - distribution circulation and subscription system.
			- legacy DB. Still used to export daily print distribution list
	- Some things from these systems moved to data warehouse
		- principally GA data & firebase
		- Capture BlueConic
		- Martech applications captured mostly through FE GA Events
		- Nothing really captured on the Advertising side, but do capture some of our own FB Ad Data, Google Ads, raw commenting data via Forua, Auth0, some SF, Salesforce, Eventbrite
	- Site data dollection
		- GA
		- Chartbeat
		- [[Mather]] - Major #vendor
			- Economics consultant for pricing
			- Marketing team uses them as data science capability
			- Lot of overlap with what we're collecting on the listener side
				- we have to support it
				- Starting to explore Google Ad Tag Manager Serverside
					- one tag collects data on your site, then can reshape it for Mather
			- provide their own churn model
			- [ ] #task Meet [[Mather]] Econometrics #vendor ðŸ”¼
		- Comscore
			- Necessary evil
			- Just upgraded to a higer quality peer feedback data
		- Optimize: AB Testing tool
			- tightly integrated with GA
			- Been too filled with friction to do good experiment design for Product / Engineering teams
			- Data needs in conflict with eng/product usability / experiment design needs
		- OneTrust - CCPA compliance (GeoIPed to California)
			- We get a lot of CCPA requests, which we can't do
			- Nobody told Mark CCPA compliance and audits were his job
			- **we have never resourced #governance nor compliance here and have huge issues around governance and compliance as a result**
		- BlueConic: Customer Data Platform
			-
			- "Resolve user identity" - Tracks user behavior in a customer focused model.
				- Collects on frontend AND backend
			- Should be able to drive customer behavior
				- "give me users who've read sports articles in the last 30 days" and can export that to Marketing Cloud
			- Super JS based; doesn't work well with AMP
			- Implemented in an ad-hoc way, so not piped in with unified definitions or source-true definitions
			-
		- Wunderkind (formerly BounceX) - marketing integration. Used for driving newsletter signup.
			- Could all be done in BlueConic.
		- Brown Institute has a Snowplow Analytics (self-hosted analytics).
			- Potential recommendation engine tool. Talk to [[Todd Gillespe]]. Related to Feeds
		- Ad Tracking: We haven't been involved in their work
			- Just in the beginning stages of partnering with them.
				- Some opportunities to support with data warehouse
					- Ads Group would be a good customer group for [[Data Platform]] / [[Data Warehouse]]. Think of them as a key
			- Sources:
				- Google Ad Manager:
					- tools suck, we created ourselves and are no longer paying some consultants.
					- We want to warehouse and optimize our work for them.
				- LiveIntent (new): Newsletters & news alerts
		- Commenting:
			- Viafoura - Commenting platform
				- disabled year and a half ago except for sports
				- Track FE events (comments) and have raw commenting data of individual users; so could use in segmentation
					- We are ingesting the data from Viafoura
						- batch nightly
						- [x] #task Let Becky know we have the Viafoura commenting data available âœ… 2022-01-12
- Purpose: **Rebuild your confidence in yourself** so you can be great leader, father, husband, and friend. Become the inspiring optimist again. #card
