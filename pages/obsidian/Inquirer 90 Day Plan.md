# Learning Plan

^eaf3fb

## Learning Plan Template:
### Before Entry
- Find out whatever you can about the organization's strategy, structure, performance, and people.
- Look for external assessments of the performance of the organization. You will learn how knowledgeable, fairly unbiased people view it. If you are a manager at a lower level, talk to people who deal with your new group as suppliers or customers.
- Find external observers who know the organization well, including former employees, recent retirees, and people who have transacted business with the organization. Ask these people open-ended questions about history, politics, and culture. Talk with your predecessor if possible.
- Talk to your new boss.
- [ ] As you begin to learn about the organization, write down your first impressions and eventually some hypotheses.
- [ ] Compile an initial set of questions to guide your structured inquiry after you arrive.

### Soon after entry
- Review detailed operating plans, performance data, and personnel data.
- Meet one-on-one with your direct reports and ask them the questions you compiled. You will learn about convergent and divergent views and about your reports as people.
- Assess how things are going at *key interfaces*. You will hear how salespeople, purchasing agents, customer service representatives, and others perceive your organization's dealings with external constituencies. You will also learn about problems they see that others do not.
	- ***People at key interface roles see problems that others do not.***
- Test strategic alignment from the top down. Ask people at the top what the company's vision and strategy are. Then see how far down into the organizational hirerchy those beliefs penetrate. You will learn how well the previous leader drove vision and strategy down through the organization.
- Test awareness of challenges and opportunities from the bottom up. Start by asking frontline people how they view the company's challenges and opportunities. Then work your way up.
- Update your questions and hypotheses.
- Meet with your boss to discuss your hypotheses and findings.

### By the end of the first month
- Gather your team to feed back to them your preliminary findings. You will elicit confirmation and challenges of your assessments and Wii's learn more  about the group and its dynamics.
- Now analyze key interfaces from the outside in. You will learn how people on the outside (suppliers, customers, distributors, and others) perceive your organization and its strengths and weaknesses.
- Analyze a couple of key processes. Convene representatives of the the responsible groups to map out and evaluate the processes you selected. You will learn about productivity, quality, and reliability.
- Meet with key integrators. You will learn how things work at interfaces among functional areas. What problems do they perceive that others do not? Seek out the natural historians. They can fill you in on the history, culture, and politics of the organization, and they are also potential allies and influencers.
- Update your questions and hypotheses.
- Meet with your boss again to discuss your observations.

## Fundamental Organizational Research (Personal)

*These are questions which I should individually seek to understand the answers to to diagnose the organizational needs and capabilities of the company and the job. As I hold conversations with colleagues, read through internal documents, and external assessments, I should try to come to specific answers. The origin of many of these questions is the book [[The First 90 Days]].*

You should draft an interview template for structured learning conversations to get to the bottom of these questions in colleague conversations.

### Questions About the Past:

**Performance:**
* How has the Inquirer performed in the past? How do people in the organization think it has performed?
* How were goals set? We're they in sufficiently or overly ambitious?
* Were internal or external benchmarks used?
* What measures were employed? What behaviors did they encourage and discourage?
* What happened if goals were not met?

**Root Causes:**
* If performance has been good, why has that been the case?
* What have been the relative contributions of strategy, structure, systems, talent bases, culture, and politics?
* If performance has been poor, why has that been the case? Do the primary issues reside in the Inquirer's strategy? Its structure? Its technical capabilities? Its culture? Its politics?

**History of Change:**
* What efforts have been made to change the organization? What happened?
	* What was behind the decision to consolidate behind the single brand of The Inquirer? How was that decision made? What was its purpose? Were those desired outcomes achieved? What was lost in that transition?
* Who has been instrumental in shaping the organization?

### Questions about the Present

**Vision and Strategy**
* What is the stated vision and strategy?
* Is the organization really pursuing that strategy? If not, why not? If so, will the strategy take the organization where it needs to go?

**People**
* Who is capable, and who is not?
* Who is trustworthy, and who is not?
* Who has influence, and why?

**Processes**
* What are the key processes?
* Are they performing acceptably in quality, reliability, and timeliness? If not, why not?
* Is the organization actively learning new things? If so where? How are learnings being disseminated and uptaken throughout the rest of the organization? How do they become a part of operations and strategy?

**Land Mines:**
* What lurking surprises could detonate and push you off track?
* What politically damaging cultural or political missteps must you avoid?

**Early Wins:**
* In what areas (people, relationships, processes, or products) can you achieve some early wins?

### Questions About the Future

**Challenges and Opportunities**
* In what areas is the organization likely to face stiff challenges in the coming year? What can be done now to prepare for them?
* What are the most promising unexploited opportunities? What would need to happen to realize their potential?

**Barriers and Resources**
* What are the most formidable barriers to making needed changes? Are they technical? Cultural? Political?
* Are there islands of excellence or other high-quality resources that you can leverage?
* What new capabilities need to be developed or acquired?

**Culture:**
* Which elements of the culture should be preserved?
* Which elements need to change?
