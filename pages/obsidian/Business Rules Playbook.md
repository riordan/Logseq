- Currently Stalled: owned by [[rachelc]]. Asked for by [[Pete Doucette]]
	- Literally just sentences like "We send emails to winbacks"
	- "All new digital subs are activated at the beginning of their subscriptions"; extremely generic
- rippling into mara's work:
	- couldn't give an answer to what campaigns are we currently running
	- using different language for the same thing and visa versa
- How to start it:
	- [[User Story Mapping]] - start w/ blog posts and chapters
	- Already begun some User Journey Mapping
