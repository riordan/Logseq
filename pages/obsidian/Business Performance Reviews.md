# Overview: Business Performance Review
[Doc Version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ixWMSY8Q2LDX2AeC83am5x5J1AqAm6pvj82ta3fEVF8/edit#)
## Overview
Newly formed process, being created by [[Lydia Hamilton]] and the [[Inquirer Operations]] group, to provide our executive leadership visibility into how the Inquirer is doing through a structured periodic update of each department.

Every department will share their update in this form 3x/yr with a focus on:
- What's going on in each department
- Status of commitments made
- Metrics assessing commitment progress and health, departmental health, and progress toward organizational goals
  
  The goal of these is to provide the executive team a tool to understand what activities are being undertaken across the whole of The Inquirer, go deep, ask questions, and ultimately help The Inquirer be organized to make better decisions, faster.
  
  The attendees will be:
- Standing Members:
	- Executive Team:
		- ([[Lisa Hughes|CEO]], [[michael zimbalist|Chief Strategy Officer]], [[Matt Boggie]])
	- [[Lydia Hamilton]] - [[Inquirer Operations|Operations]]
- Department leads for groups presenting that month ^4brqfp
  
  Each month, 2 departments will present a detailed update, rotating so that each department presents 3x/year.
## Our Role
Our role in this project will be to assist [[Lydia Hamilton|Lydia]] in creating the elements of this process that help communicate these updates and the mechanisms to track the progress over time. The short version of that is:
- A slide deck template - to help structure what we're looking to get from each briefing
- The baseline metrics we'll be expecting from everyone
- What kinds of group/project specific metrics we'll want to see
- A tracking mechanism (e.g. an eventual dashboard) for tracking progress against stated goals over time.
  
  We're here in our capacity to help facilitate communicating complex information, clearly to senior leaders to both build their familiarity with this work, but also to give them the means to really examine what's going on and why. Meanwhile this complex information is to be prepared and presented by people who know they're under the microscope, so we want to create tools that help guide them toward communicating that well, without allowing them to hide from tough questions through razzle-dazzle presentation techniques and designs.
  
  Ultimately, we want to help each group stay focused in the content they present so it's highly relevant, while giving them a meaningful way to communicate nuanced details, and to raise concerns to executives. We also need to decide what's a meaningful way to keep these updated and tracked.
  
  We aim to have this operational in a month or two. I'm hoping that we can have something usable to begin workshopping with the exec team in about 3 weeks (week of [[2022-02-01]]).
## Background
We don't have this sort of regular briefing structure here at The Inquirer, so it's possible for our execs not to know about important work that's going on, to learn from it, or help align it with other work that's happening elsewhere. [[Lydia Hamilton|Lydia]]'s built these kinds of [update structures and frameworks](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Annual_Plan/Tuning_sessions) previously at The Wikimedia Foundation.

Our ability to help here will assist in the [[Data and Insights Group]]'s overall efforts to make The Inquirer more aligned with our Strategy, and to ensure that our Strategy is fully aligned with The Inquirer's Mission.

# Misc Thoughts
- **[[2022-01-13]] - Should [[Business Performance Reviews#^4brqfp|Presenting Department Leads]] be able to bring a deputy or two to go deep on things?**
	- Be expected to cover and present on it but not have to know everything off the top of their head and ask someone on their team more knowledgable.1
