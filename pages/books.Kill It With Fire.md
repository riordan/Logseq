	  Economists have a different explanation for adoption rates of new technology. They typically describe it as the contrast between alignable and nonalignable differences. Alignable differences are those for which the consumer has a reference point. For example, this car is faster than that car, or this phone has a better camera than that phone. Nonalignable differences are characteristics that are wholly unique and innovative; there are no reference points with which to compare. You might assume that nonalignable differences are more appealing to potential consumers. After all, there’s no competition! You’re doing things differently from everyone else. But when it comes time to make a purchasing decision, if there is no comparison, there is no clear sense of value. How does one judge the worth of something—and therefore estimate the trade-offs of buying it at a particular price—that has no equivalent? For a nonalignable difference to make an impact, the estimated value it produces has to be greater than all the alignable differences and all the other nonalignable differences put together.1

	  Therefore, products of all kinds differentiate themselves on the market by finding specific characteristics that can be labeled as different from characteristics of existing solutions. This pushes technology into cycles. People do not get exactly the same experience from the same products. As a company iterates to improve a certain characteristic of the product, it ultimately makes the product less desirable for the group of existing customers. Companies do this with the hope that a larger group of new customers will make that loss irrelevant.

	  Simply producing a cellphone that was geared toward teenagers in the 1990s or the early 2000s would not have led to an explosion of growth. Teenagers had no strong reference point for cellphones. From their viewpoint, there were no alignable differences attractive enough to justify the expense. It was only once their parents’ devices became prevalent in cultural references and everyday life that the market potential of teenagers and the large screens necessary to capture their interest were unlocked.
